If the input tree contains a feature named \"Ne\" assigned to each node then it will automatically assign Ne values to the corresponding species tree branches. Call `.sim_trees(1)` from your model object to simulate one coalescent genealogy embedded in the species tree. Then call `.draw_demography(0)` from the model object to draw the tree embedding."
