### The Evolutionary History of Life 
Chapter 17 of your textbook provides a summary of the major transitions in the
history of life on Earth. From the origin of life as replicating molecules that
became encapsulated in cells; to transformation of global biogeochemical cycles
by metabolism of single-celled organisms; to major endosymbiotic events that 
led to the evolution of multicellular life forms; to the diversification of 
animal body plans; the spread of plants and animals from sea to land; and 
mass extinction events that caused rapid turnover in clades. 

As students in an ecology and evolution department you are likely familiar 
with many of these stories. There are countless facts to learn about the 
history of the evolution of life on Earth as an be reconstructed from the 
fossil record and other lines of evidence. It is outside the scope of this
class to cover all of these. But it is in your interest to learn about this, 
and to put many of these major events and their timing to memory. A general 
understanding of the history of life acts like a calibration in your mind
to better understand the scale and rate of both gradual and catastrophic 
events in the history of the evolution of life on Earth that is important
to a general understanding of evolution. Some notes:

- The first fossil evidence of life dates to 3.8 billion years ago, about 
1 billion years after the formation of Earth, and is of single-celled 
prokaryotes.
- Multicellular Eukaryotes evolved by 1.8 billion years ago.
- The geological time-scale is defined by eras and epochs with distinct names
and which last different lengths. The boundaries between these periods are 
defined by characteristic changes in the diversity of organisms that occur in
the fossil record within each era. Thus, mass extinction events mark several
boundaries where rapid changes to diversity occurred.
- See the Geological Time Scale Appendix at back of textbook.
- The composition of life on land and in the sea changed tremendously 
through time as new types of organisms not only diversified but also created
new niches by creating and transforming the biosphere. 
- The Pleistocene epoch began about 2.6 Mya. This period was characterized by
large changes in global temperates and massive glaciation that had large 
effects on recent patterns of biodiversity. The last major glacial cycle ended 
between 15-8 Kya. 

### The evolution of biological diversity
We will move on to topics from Chapter 18 of the textbook, which are more 
concerned with **pattern and process** in the history of life and diversity,
as opposed to its details. This concerns major questions such as:

- **How has diversity changed through time?** What processes cause changes to 
the number of species that exist? (Speciation, Extinction, Adaptation, 
Geological/climate change).

- **At what rate do changes occur?** Have they occurred relatively constant, 
or at variable rates? More turnover in recent versus past times? 
How can/should this be quantified?

### Quantifying diversity
"Diversity" is often used to refer to the number of species, but why
are species a unit of interest? Why not the number of populations, number of
genera, number of families? Answer: higher-level taxa are (more) subjective
since they vary greatly in size and age, whereas species represent a single 
cohesive unit that can either speciate or go extinct. 

Yet, higher level taxa are easier to observe as being present or absent
in the fossil record, and so they are more frequently used in paleontological
studies to quantify biodiversity.
Similarly, hard-bodied marine organisms fossilize much more readily than soft-
bodied organisms, and so our best estimates of changes in diversity 
through time often focus on these taxa and their very detailed fossil record.

Changes in diversity through time can be studied by two means: paleontology 
and phylogenetics. These often apply models from ecology to model how 
diversity has changed through time, e.g., population ecology models to test
for limits on diversity (i.e., carrying-capacity). What might impose such
limits at a global scale of diversity? (competition, resources, mass 
extinctions, limits on partitioning habitats, diversity of existing habitats?)

### Biodiversity patterns today
How many species exist today? How do we quantify this?

- Mammals: 6400 species
- Birds: ~10,000 species
- Flowering plants: 250,000-400,000 species
- Fungi: ~100,000 described, estimated to be millions

How do we know this? For well-studied macro-organisms (e.g., mammals and
birds) the rate of discovery of new species has greatly slowed, such that
we can be confident most have been described. For groups that are much larger
or less well studied, estimates are usually "best guesses" based on the 
numbers that have been described and the rate of new discoveries. A number
of approaches have been applied based on taxonomy, statistics, and sampling 
theory to estimate more precise numbers, but these studies often disagree
by large degrees, especially for organisms like insects or fungi. 


### Latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG)
The latitudinal diversity gradient is one of the most well-established patterns
in ecology. There is greater diversity near the equator than near polar regions
of Earth. However, there are countless hypotheses for why this pattern exists
and how it originated. Most likely, aspects of many of these hypotheses together
have played in role in creating this pattern. 

Regardless of the specific explaination for the latitudinal diversity gradient, 
we know that more generally there are just three ways for the diversity within
a region to change: speciation, extintion, and dispersal. 

Given these three processes, most hypotheses to explain differences in diversity
between different regions can be categorized into just three types: 

1. Differences in carrying capactity. Regions may differ in the number of species
they can support. For example, many hypotheses for the LDG propose that higher
energy availability in the tropics allows it to support greater diversity.

2. Differences in diversification. Diversification can happen faster in the 
tropics if either the speciation rates are higher or extinction rates are 
lower. Are the tropics a cradle of new diversity (high speciation) or a museum
of ancient diversity (low extinction)? Several hypotheses for the LDG propose
mechanisms for why it could be either or both.

3. Differences in the age of areas. Perhaps the tropics are more diverse simply
because that habitat/ecosystem has existed longer. Throughout Earth history
there has been greatly more land area in the tropics than in temperate 
regions when you factor in plate tectonics and climate change.

Are there limits on species diversity? Have these limits changed through time? 
(e.g., adaptation from sea to land, increased limits?)
Are we currently at a limit (prior to human impacts). What could 
limit diversity from reaching theoretical limits?

### Diversification 
Why do some lineages "radiate" (adaptive radiation)?

- ecological opportunity/release
- key innovations
- How to identify key innovations?
	- Example: herbivory in insects. Compare diversity of sister clades (same age).
	- Diversification rate analysis. Analyze multiple transitions on a phylogeny.
	- Are there evolutionary dead ends?

### Diversity patterns through time

#### Raup and Sepkoski Curves

- 4-5 mass extinctions vary from background rate of extinction.
- background extinction rate has decreased since Camb.
- O, P, T, K, maybe also D.
- Let's discuss the timeline, how hard is it to read this type of work without knowing the epoch names?
- Isn't it nice that you could get a Science paper for a simple linear regression in 1982? Only two authors, who measured all these data?
- bg ext rate decreased despite the number of families existing increasing greatly.
- is this a result of "optimization of fitness through time?" Keep this in mind 
as we progress to fitness discussions.
- The decreasing background ext rate can explain the increase in diversity 
through the Phanerozoic: no increase in speciation required.


<!-- 
- What do you think the authors mean by an “optimization of fitness” to
increase through time?
	- Are they referring to the fitness of individuals? Of genes? Of species? Of families? Will these things be correlated?
 -->
<!-- 
**Macroevolutionary models** Given a phylogeny, we can map characters to 
the tips of a tree and fit different statistical models for the evolution
of that character. This is a very common practice in modern evolutionary 
biology. Because we can only observe the present (in the absence of fossils) 
we must ask *which model of evolution is most likely to have produced the 
type of variation that we observe today?* We usually start by fitting simple
models (e.g., Brownian motion) and compare this to more complex models. We 
will revisit these types of models in a later session on *phylogenetic methods*.
-->
 
### The fossil record

**Consistency in the fossil record** Layers dating to the same 
epoch everywhere in the world show the same linear patterns of 
diversity through time. This is one of the most clear and striking
forms of evidence for evolution.

**The fossil record is highly incomplete** What we see in museum 
exhibits is often the highlights, a best example of a preserved 
individual. However, the vast majority of paleontological data is 
more mundane. Millions of records of small and often fragmentary 
samples that are sufficient to record presence/absence of a 
taxon (often at the level of family or genus) in a certain place
at a certain time. However, from these mundane records we can 
apply statistical methods to model this history of life, and this
way, often learn much more than we could from any single well 
preserved macro-fossil.

<!-- **Diversity through time**. How has the diversity of life changed
through time? We all know of certain mass extinction events, like 
the dinosaurs, and that 

Famous Sepkoski curve; diversity of skeletonized marine animal families 
and genera throughout the Phanerozoic, and the distinction of "evolutionary 
fauna". Not only did diversity change through time, and apparent limits on it,
but its composition did as well with some families replacing others. (Fig. 19.4, 19.6)

- Speciation has been greater than extinction in general. There is 
some "background extinction rate", and there are "mass extinctions".

- In fact, the background extinction rate is thought to have decreased
through time (Raup and Sepkoski). Does this mean organisms are 
becoming better adapted? The origination of new families also decreased.
Does this mean diversity is more saturated? 
These are Macroevolutionary questions. -->

- Why might some lineages have higher rates of speciation and/or extinction? 
One idea is specialization vs generalization. Specialized for a specific 
environment, or prey, or symbiont, etc., leaves you vulnerable and dependent 
on that taxon. Sp/Ext are often correlated.

- The "Red Queen hypothesis": Running faster and faster just to keep in place.
Van Valen showed that extinction probabilities are constant; taxa do 
not appear to become more adapted to their environment. This is b/c their 
(biotic) environment is always adapting as well. They need to 
evolve at full speed just to stay in even.

### Extinction of species and biomes
- Number of extinctions recorded.
- Number of extinct species re-discovered.
- De-extinction.
- Habitat/biome loss or conversion. Can it be restored?
- The evolution of biomes.
- Population declines versus extinction. Insects, birds, plants.

## The fossil record
- Geologists long debated whether diversity was at a steady-state throughout
most of paleohistory, or if it showed a trend towards increasing. It is now
broadly accepted that it increased from Paleozoic to Mesozoic, and again from
Mesozoic to Cenozoic. Highest within last 100 Mya.
- Record is composed primarily of hard-bodied marine organisms.
- Fossilization requires sedimentation. Common in oceans, rare in terrestrial
habitats. Even in oceans it is somewhat unpredictable. Good fossil beds
are found on continental shelf (shallow, diverse, high sedimentation) but 
these habitats appear or disappear quickly with changes in sea level.
- 

## Discussion notes
Discussion Questions:
- How could/should we prioritize conservation efforts to prevent extinctions?
- Is habitat conservation sufficient in light of climate change?
- Should we concern ourselves with conserving processes that originate diversity (long-term)? 
- How can/should global societies contribute equitably to conservation when the distribution of biodiversity is non-uniform?
- How much worse is extinction than our current shifting baseline of habitat, biomass, and biodiversity loss?

## Lecture notes
This lecture focuses on the quantitative methods for describing and measuring
phenotypic variation, additive genetic variance, fitness, and selection. It
is largely a review of foundational work from the Modern Synthesis, with 
updated examples from more modern implementations.

TODO...

### Phenotypic variation
...

### Additive genetic variance
*Additive genetic variance* is the proportion of variance in phenotype
that can be explained by genetic variation, and not by the environment.
...

### Absolute fitness
The concept of fitness is fundamental to evolutionary biology.

If the mean absolute fitness in a population increases due to adaptative
evolution this can increase the population density, geographic range, 
or growth rate in ways that may reduce the probability of population 
extinction due to random fluctuations or environmental change.

The rate of evolution of the mean absolute fitness of a population 
(i.e., the change in fitness in response to selection) provides a 
meaningful approach of measuring the rate of adaptation. 

## Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection
*The rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal
to its genetic variance in fitness at that time*. In other words, 
there must be variation in fitness for selection to ...

In Fisher's most famous work on evolution, *The genetical Theory of 
Natural Selection* (1930), he described a model for the rate of 
adaptive evolution that has since come to be called Fisher's fundamental
theorem.

This shows that the change in mean *relative fitness* due to selection 
(...) equals the additive genetic variance in relative fitness in a population
($\sigma^2_A$), making the additive genetic variance in relative fitness 
arguably the most important evolutionary parameter for a population.




$$ w = \sigma^{2}_{A}(s) $$




### Adaptations
Nature is full of apparant design: a fit between an organism's phenotype 
and a specific function (3.1, 3.2). Darwin's theory of natural selection 
provides an explanation for this apparent design. It is the outcome of a 
mindless process, natural selection. It does not require an intelligent designer.

This had an enormous impact on the way in which we understand the natural
world... Transformed societies through the way we see the world, and the 
way in which we view humans to be part of it (We also evolved). 

Evidence of adaptations is used widely to support the theory of evolution
by natural selection, since adaptations are an expected outcome of natural 
selection. But how exactly do you define an adaptation, and how can 
hypotheses about adaptations be tested?


### Definitions
**Adaptation:** *a characteristic that enhances (or enhanced) the survival 
or reproduction of organisms that bear it, relative to alternative character
states.*

Adaptive evolution may be slow as Darwin proposed, but nevertheless we now 
have many examples where it has been clearly observed and measured within 
our lifetimes.
	- Soapberry example (Fig.-3.x)
	- resistance to insecticide, herbicide, antibiotics (Fig-3.x)
	- response to overexploitation (Fig.-3.5)

**Natural selection:** *any consistent difference in fitness among 'different 
classes' (e.g., genotypes) of biological entities based on their 
phenotypes.*

**Fitness:** (reviewed in our article discussion today) *The number of 
offspring an individual leaves in the next generation.* Or, measured
as multiple components of fitness for multiple life stages. 

**Important Note**: Natural selection can occur without causing evolution 
(e.g., no heritability of selected trait), and similarly, evolution 
can occur without natural selection (e.g., genetic drift changes allele
frequencies by chance). Natural selection happens anytime that a 
non-random set of entities differ in fitness. For evolution to happen, 
the non-random variation affecting their fitness must be heritable.

### Levels of selection
We used the term 'entities' for natural selection earlier, why? 
Because not only individuals experience selection. Genotypes or, 
b/c of recombination, individual genes (in sexual organisms), can 
also have differences in success/fitness (replication to next 
generation). Thus selection can act on gene copies in a population, 
combination of gene copies in a population (genotypes), individuals
in a population (classic concept of selection), or even on different
populations (group selection; thought to be less common).

Selfish genetic elements: Segments of DNA or RNA that can replicate
*within* genomes. This is beneficial because when the genome is 
replicated this leads to further replication of the copies
of this element in the genome. Examples are **transposable elements**
(TEs). These often have either no effect on fitness, or only slightly
deleterious effects, and thus accumulate in genomes.

TODO Reference: transposable element diversity and distribution in genomes.

### Adaptive/Fitness landscape:

A bivariate or multivariate plot showing fitness x phenotype(s), or 
fitness x genotypes(s). It is often easier to envision and measure
for phenotypes, which may vary continuously in a population, than 
for genotypes, which vary discretely. One should thus think of 
genotypes as composing allelic combinations at many loci, such that
you could imagine continuous-like variation.

An adaptive landscape can show both local and global optima, 
represented as *peaks* on the landscape, surrounded by *valleys*
with lower fitness. Movement between fitness peaks on a landscape
is a major topic of interest in evolution. Do populations get
stuck on suboptimal peaks? How easy is it to move between peaks
of similar fitness? How does the depth of valleys influence the
probabilities of shifts?


### Shifting Balance Theory
Wright developed the ["shifting balance theory"](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/sewall-wright-and-the-development-of-shifting-30508/).
This proposed that the effects of pairs of alleles should not always be 
modeled as simply being *additive* (sum of their individual effects), but 
should also include the potential for *non-additive* effects, such
as epistasis. Epistatic effects such as dominance were well known 
from Mendel's earlier work, but later work revealed many additional
forms of epistasis, including incomplete dominance (intermediate
phenotypes due to interactions, not just additive effects; 
e.g., pink). Wright examined what would happen under theoretical models
where these different modes of heterozygote phenotypes have different
fitness consequences (e.g., lower than either homozygote, intermediate, 
or greater).

Wright developed the concept of adative landscapes to describe the 
predicted evolution of populations given a relationship between 
genotypes and fitness. Selection will push populations upward toward
genotypes of higher fitness, whereas genetic drift or random mutations
will cause populations to disperse around regions of similar fitness

At its core, the shifting balance theory is a process that permits populations
to hold onto selective gains (i.e., local fitness peaks in the adaptive 
landscape) while still being able to randomly explore neighboring genotype 
space for possibly superior peaks. Wright's solution to these conflicting 
aims was population subdivision. He thought that many, if not most, species
were subdivided into small populations that exchanged only a few migrants 
with each other but were not completely isolated (Wright, 1931, 1932, 1977, 
1978). Because of the small size of each of these populations, genetic drift 
would have a significant effect on the genetic composition of each, thus 
allowing the populations to differentiate genetically by an appreciable amount. 
In this way, each of the populations would act as a small experiment in 
evolution (Wade & Goodnight, 1998).

- Phase 1, the exploratory phase, is characterized by the action of genetic 
drift. As a result, the small populations move around in genotypic space.
Most stay on the suboptimal fitness peak, but some get caught in adaptive valleys.
- In phase 2, natural selection causes the populations that are in the adaptive
valleys to move through genotypic space toward new, higher-fitness peaks.
- Finally, in phase 3, those populations that are at higher fitness peaks send 
off migrants to the other populations, and these migrants cause the other 
populations to move to the higher fitness peaks. Eventually, all of the 
populations (the metapopulation) move to the higher fitness peak as a result 
of this process.

Remains controversial. 

Fisher argued that ecological factors would change the adaptive landscape 
faster than populations could shift between peaks via the shifting balance 
theory. In other words, according to Fisher, hills would become valleys and 
valleys would become hills faster than populations could move from one hill
to the next (Fisher, 1958).

### On adaptations
How to talk about adaptations/selection. We often use shorthand but this
can sound teleological or anthropomorphic in ways that can be misleading
to the general public. It is important to be aware of this and thus when
and where it is appropriate to further define your meaning.
	- selection 'favors' this...
	- selection is a force...
In the end, natural selection is a "statistical differences in 
reproductive success among genes, organisms, or populations, 
based on variation among them".

### Evidence of adaptations
Why are adaptation hard to identify? We will examine this in greater
detail in a later chapter when we describe methods for detecting 
adaptations from signatures in genomes. However, it is useful to 
introduce some of these ideas now as well.

1. A trait may be necessary due to physics, chemistry, constraints. Hemoglobin 
is red b/c of chemistry, not due to selection for blood to be red in color. 
(3.15 exaptation)
2. Trait may have evolved by random genetic drift.
3. May be correlated with another character that evolved by 
	selection, drift, developmental constraint, etc.
4. Phylogenetic history. Why do humans have live birth instead of laying eggs? 
The reason is not because live birth evolved *in humans*, relative to an 
egg-laying ancestor, rather, long ago an ancestor with a variable 
egg-laying/live-birth transition likely experienced selection for one versus 
the other. 

Inconclusive, but suggestive evidence for adaptations
**Complexity**: why does a complex trait exist and not something simpler? 
Example: peacock's feathers. More complex features likely involve costs 
to fitness. Non-functional complexities will usually degrade by 
genetic drift if not maintained by selection.

**Design**: corresponds with optimized models: aerodynamics, heat dissipation, 
camouflage. Similarity with a theoretical optimum model
is highly unlikely to evolve by random genetic drift. 

**Experiments**: show that a trait is better than a modified 
version of it. You could paint a peacock's feathers white and measure
its relative fitness. This shows evidence that the trait is 
more fit in this population than *this alternative*, but does not test
many other alternatives, and does not test whether the alternative 
trait could have evolved in this population's history, and if, whether
it would then be more fit.

**Comparative method**: Phylogenetic patterns can reveal repeated evolution 
that is unlikely by random chance. (e.g., Anoles, Sticklebacks, 
[Viburnum](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01823-x)).

**Imperfections and constraints**: Selection acts on existing organisms,
not from scratch, and thus often finds imperfect pathways to solutions.
For example, selection can increase the frequency of genetic variants
in a particular population at a particular time. It cannot fix the best 
of all conceivable variants because that combination may be very 
unlikely to arise by chance. We will return to this in sessions on LTEE 
and in development.
