... This chapter tells the story of
our understanding of the history of life on Earth, and how major geological
and/or evolutionary events impacted diversity. It is the story of evolution
as a non-equilibrial process -- the diversity of life has always changed 
through time -- and of the role of extinction as both a constant background
event as well as, occasionally, a catastrophic event leading to great turnover.

### The evolution of biological diversity
**Major questions about life history** How has diversity changed over time? 
What processes cause changes to the number of species that exist? (Speciation,
Extinction, Adaptation, Geological/climate change). (Fig-19.1).

**At what rate do changes occur?** Have they occurred relatively
constant, or at variable rates? More turnover in recent versus past times? How
should this be quantified?


### Quantifying diversity
"Diversity" is often used to refer to the number of species, but why
are species a unit of interest? Why not number of populations, number of
genera, number of families? Answer: higher-level taxa are (more) subjective, 
but also easier to measure in the fossil record.

Has the number of species changed dramatically through time? Has the number 
of genera or families changes more or less? 

Changes in diversity through time can be studied by two means: paleontology 
and phylogenetics. These often apply models from ecology to model diversity
through time similar to how ecologists model population size through time. 
E.g., are there limits (carrying-capacity) on the number of 
(spp/genera/families)? What might impose these limits? (competition, 
resources, mass extinctions, limits on partitioning habitats, diversity 
of existing habitats?)

### Latitudinal diversity gradient
...

### Spatial biodiversity patterns
... birds, mammals, plants, insects. 

### Biodiversity hotspots 
richness, endemism, and threatened.

### Generating diversity
How do differences in diversity among clades arise? For example, orchids 
versus oak trees? Speciation and extinction (Fig. 19.3)

- time since origination
- speciation - extinction differ (unbounded)
- speciation - extinction differ (due to limits; carry cap.)

Are there limits on species diversity? Have these limits changed through time? 
(e.g., adaptation from sea to land, increased limits?)
Are we currently at a limit (prior to human impacts). What could 
limit diversity from reaching theoretical limits?

### Diversification 
Why do some lineages "radiate" (adaptive radiation)?

- ecological opportunity/release (19.12)
- key innovations
- How to identify key innovations?
	- Example: herbivory in insects (19.13) Sister clades, same age.
	- Diversification rate analysis (19.15)
	- Branch length distributions on molecular phylogenies for divrates.
	- Evolutionary dead ends? We will return to this topic later.

### Raup and Sepkoski Curves

- 4-5 mass extinctions vary from background
- O, P, T, K, maybe all D.
- background ext decreased since Camb.
- Let's discuss the timeline, how hard is it to read this type of work without knowing the epoch names?
- Isn't it nice that you could get a Science paper for a simple linear regression in 1982? Only two authors, who measured all this data?
- bg ext rate decreased despite the number of families existing increasing greatly.
- is this a result of "optimization of fitness through time?" Keep this in mind as we progress to fitness discussions.
- The decreaseing bd ext rate can explain the increase in diversity through the Phanerozoic: not increase in speciation required.

- What do you think the authors mean by an “optimization of fitness” to increase through time?
	- Are they referring to the fitness of individuals? Of genes? Of species? Of families? Will these things be correlated?

### The fossil record (Signor)

**Consistency in the fossil record** Layers dating to the same 
epoch everywhere in the world show the same linear patterns of 
diversity through time. This is one of the most clear and striking
forms of evidence for evolution. 

**The fossil record is highly incomplete** What we see in museum 
exhibits is often the highlights, a best example of a preseved 
individual. However, the vast majority of paleontological data is 
more mundane. Millions of records of small and often fragmentary 
samples that are sufficient to record presence/absence of a 
taxon (often at the level of family or genus) in a certain place
at a certain time. However, from these mundane records we can 
apply statistical methods to model this history of life, and this
way, often learn much more than we could from any single well 
preserved fossil.

**Diversity through time**. How has the diversity of life changed
through time? We all know of certain mass extinction events, like 
the dinosaurs, and that 

Famous Sepkoski curve; diversity of skeletonized marine animal families 
and genera throughout the Phanerozoic, and the distinction of "evolutionary 
fauna". Not only did diversity change through time, and apparent limits on it,
but its composition did as well with some families replacing others. (Fig. 19.4, 19.6)

- Speciation has been greater than extinction in general. There is 
some "background extinction rate", and there are "mass extinctions".

- In fact, the background extinction rate is thought to have decreased
through time (Raup and Sepkoski). Does this mean organisms are 
becoming better adapted? The origination of new families also decreased.
Does this mean diversity is more saturated? 
These are Macroevolutionary questions.

- Why might some lineages have higher rates of speciation and/or extinction? 
One idea is specialization vs generalization. Specialized for a specific 
environment, or prey, or symbiont, etc., leaves you
vulnerable and dependent on that taxon. Sp/Ext are often correlated.

- The "Red Queen hypothesis": Running faster and faster just to keep in place.
Van Valen showed that extinction probabilities are constant; taxa do 
not appear to become more adapted to their environment. This is b/c their 
(biotic) environment is always adapting as well. They need to 
evolve at full speed just to stay in even.

### Extinction of species and biomes

- Number of extinctions recorded.
- Number of extinct species re-discovered.
- De-extinction.
- Habitat/biome loss or conversion. Can it be restored?
- The evolution of biomes.
- Population declines versus extinction. Insects, birds, plants.


## Discussion notes

- Signor
	- Do you think the fossil record is reliable enough for Sepkoski curve?

Discussion Questions:
- How could/should we prioritize conservation efforts to prevent extinctions?
- Is habitat conservation sufficient in light of climate change?
- Should we concern ourselves with conserving processes that originate diversity (long-term)? 
- How can/should global societies contribute equitably to conservation when the distribution of biodiversity is non-uniform?
- How much worse is extinction than our current shifting baseline of habitat, biomass, and biodiversity loss?

- Human disturbance has massively transformed bird (and probably plant) 
populations over the last 50 years. But only ~12 extinctions have been
described east of the Mississippi. Are we focusing too much on complete
extinction as opposed to the disruptions caused by massive population 
declines caused by humans?
