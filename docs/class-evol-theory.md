## Notes/Review

### Evolutionary thinking
The opening page of chapter 1 in your texbook features an image of a 
caterpillar, and introduces several examples of the common questions that 
occur to us everyday for which we turn to evolutionary theory for answers 
-- often without even thinking. 

Why does an organism look the way that it does, or act the way that it 
does? Why does it occur here at this point in time? We often ask such 
questions out of natural curiousity, but answering these questions can 
also have major impacts on society, health, conservation, bio-ethics, and 
philosophy. For example, when we apply these same questions to an organism
like the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that caused the global COVID-19 pandemic, 
the answers to questions about the origin of species, and how they evolve 
novel adaptations, have obvious implications.

Evolutionary theory allows us to model the processes of mutation, dispersal,
recombination, and selection that underlie the distribution of genetic and
phenotypic variation in populations. We can apply evolutionary models to 
reconstruct phylogenetic trees that trace the origin and spread of the virus. 
We can apply evolutionary models to understand protein evolution and variation
that mediate a host's suspectibility to the virus. Common methods first 
developed to study genetic variation in populations are now commonly applied
to detect viral infections in humans in the form of PCR-based tests. Basic 
knowledge gained from understanding the evolution of bacterial defense 
mechanisms against viruses may pave the way to future medical treatments 
using CRISPR gene editing systems. All of these examples demonstrate **the 
widespread impact and importance of evolutionary theory to our everyday
lives.**


### What is evolutionary biology?
Evolution touches on all aspects of biology. From biochemical studies of 
the origin to life and the genetic code, to the development of technologies
that allow us to measure RNA, DNA and proteins; to computational and 
bioinformatic methods to study and compare these data as serialized or 
numeric values; to the study of anatomical diversity in cells,
organelles, tissues, and organisms; to patterns of relatedness among 
organisms; and even the evolution, extinction, and turnover of entire 
clades and ecosystems. Underlying all of these topics are the consequences
of *variation, heritability, and differential replication* that form the
basis of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.

While Darwin's theory forms the basis of evolutionary biology, many new 
and additional ideas and concepts have been developed in this field over the
following decades. These ideas sometimes refine or add additional explanations
to Darwin's theory, or in many cases extend evolutionary theory in ways
Darwin never could have imagined. A general theme uniting the *many theories* 
that form modern evolutionary theory is that they examine patterns in the
*history* of life (often by examining variation across living organisms) to 
identify and test generalizable processes or principles that cause such 
patterns in nature.

In many cases this involves identifying and connecting *proximate causes* of
evolution -- immediate chemical and physical phenomena underlying biological
processes like replication, cellular signaling, and development -- with 
testable hypotheses about their *ultimate causes* in the form of historical
explanations for how such phenomena came to be (i.e., evolved). 


### Definition of Biological Evolution
Biological evolution is defined as inherited change in the properties of 
**groups** of organisms over the course of generations. For evolution to 
occur requires three things: **Variation, Heritability, and Differential
survival.** Merging these two statements, the theory of biological evolution
is also referred to (originally by Darwin) as "descent with modification".

!!! tip "Common mistake"

    A single individual does not evolve over the course of its lifetime, only
    **groups** of organisms can evolve over time as the groups composition 
    changes by different replication and survival.


### Darwin and Evolution in the ether
Charles Darwin published the Origin of Species in 1859 in which he presented
abundant evidence collected over decades to support his theory of evolution
by natural selection as a new general theory to explain how organismal diversity
arises over time through a natural (i.e., not supernatural) process. This propelled
Darwin to stardom in his day, and he has since become a legendary historical 
figure in the history of science for the transformational effect this theory
has had on human culture.

Darwin himself wrote quite extensively in a biographical manner, describing 
the many influences that planted the seeds of this idea in his mind at the
time. And many historians have since studied Darwin's notes and correspondence
to contextualize his ideas within the broader scientific community and trends
during this period. Despite Darwin's great historical impact, and obvious
brilliance in his abilities to gather and synthesize data, think creatively,
and write beautifully -- it can be argued that the idea was *in the ether*, and
would have been discovered around this time even without Darwin.

Great scientific breakthroughs do not occur in isolation, but rather emerge
as a product of the work and ideas of entire communities. Thus, while Darwin
should be lauded for his great accomplishments, it is good practice 
to avoid  "hero worship" of the individuals credited with great historical
discoveries, as this can minimize the work of others, as well as set 
unattainable expectations for these individuals that they are unlikely to
live up to.

The discovery of evolution is a famous example of this, as it is well known
that another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace, independently developed the
theory of evolution by natural selection a few decades after Darwin (
who had not yet published his ideas). He was motivated by similar observations
of variation in nature -- although in his case from Southeast Asia as opposed
to South America -- and from similar influences derived from geology and 
economics.


### Darwin's theory of Evolution by Natural Selection
Darwin proposed two big ideas: that organisms have diverged over time 
since originating from a single common ancestor; and that they become 
modified over time through the process of natural selection. Together, 
these processes can explain an amazing array of observations in nature 
that were previously restricted to the realm of supernatural explanations. 
Darwin provided abundant evidence derived from decades of observations and 
experiments to support these claims, and they have held up to countless
further examination since. Darwin's theory of evolution is now widely 
accepted as a scientific fact.

!!! success "Darwin's two ideas"

    Darwin's greatest impact was not in proposing a theory of 'common
    ancestry' (descent) -- this had been done before -- but rather, he was 
    the first to propose a simple and coherent mechanism by which changes
    (modification) occur between generations in a way that can make a population
    more "fit" to their environment, through the process of natural selection. 
    By bringing these two ideas together he was the first to propose a theory
    that could explain "how" life evolves.

**Darwin's theory of evolution**

1. Organisms change over time. They are not static as proposed by Aristotle 
and long believed by Linneaus and others to be a feature of supernatural 
creation.
2. Common descent. Others had proposed theories of evolution from common
ancestors. Darwin argued *strongly* that *all* organisms shared a common 
ancestor and had diverged through a tree-like branching process. He took the
idea to the extreme and was right.
3. Gradualism. Darwin argued that evolution occurs by gradual changes leading
to slight differences in the chance of survival and reproduction played out
over very long time-scales. He was mostly right about this.
4. Variational change. He proposed that evolution occurs by changes in the 
frequencies of variants of individuals in a population over generations, 
in contrast to transformational theories that propose evolution by changes
in the individuals themselves.
5. Natural selection is the propensity for some individual variants to 
reproduce more successfully than others. Adaptations arise by changes in the
frequencies of variants in populations over time that make them better fit
to their environment.



### Darwin's major influences

**Erasmus Darwin**: Evolutionary theories for the origin of life predated 
Darwin, and in fact his grandfather Erasmus Darwin was a poet who famously 
wrote on a theory of evolution involving descent from common ancestors. 

**Personal observation**: Darwin began his career as a *naturalist*, serving
on board the HMS Beagle on a 5-year voyage to chart the coasts of South America
with the task of cataloging his observations of natural history. This voyage
lasted from 1831-1836 and began when Darwin was just 22 years old. It took 
years of interactions with other naturalists, including corresponding with 
experts on plants, birds, and other organisms that Darwin collected, for him
to fully form his ideas from observations such as the diversity among 
"Darwin's finches" in the Galapagos islands, which motivated his ideas about
descent with modification.

**Lamarck**: Among others, Jean-Baptiste Chavelier de Lamarck famously 
proposed a theory of evolution involving descent from common ancestors 50 
years before Darwin. Lamarck's theory was wrong, however, in proposing *how* 
changes among organisms evolve through time. He proposed a process by which 
*acquired characteristics* of individuals are inherited from one generation 
to the next, leading to population change. This is often demonstrated by a 
giraffe stretching its neck over its lifetime  to reach foliage, leading to 
longer necks passed on to their offspring. This theory of "inheritance of 
acquired characteristics" is known to false, but nevertheless put forward a 
testable hypothesis.

**Lyell**: In the early 19th century writings by astronomers and geologists,
including particularly those of James Hutton and Charles Lyell, transformed 
our understanding of earth history by proposing the theory of 
**uniformitarianism** -- that the same geological processes that we observe 
today, such as erosion by wind and water, are likely to be the same processes 
that gave rise to major geological formations. Thus, the Earth is very old,
and even processes with very small effects can lead to great changes over
over long periods of time.

**Malthus**: The concept of [Malthusianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism) is derived from writings of the economist Thomas Malthus, most notably his 
"Essay on the Principle of Population" in 1798. This essay argued that 
population growth would outstretch the supply of resources/food, even in the
face of technological advances, leading to eventual population collapse. This
theory has had a significant impact on ideas of population control, and as
an argument for capitalism. Darwin encountered Malthus' writing in 1838 and 
had a very different takeaway from it. He was already convinced of the common
descent of life at this point, but had not yet developed the theory of natural
selection. The idea of that many more individuals are born than can possibly
survive greatly impacted Darwin, and led him to ponder the consequences of 
*differential survival* -- that those with particular characteristics may be
more likely to survive and reproduce than others, thus passing on those 
characters to be more frequent in the subsequent generation.


### Evolutionary theories
The theory of biological/organic evolution describes the process by which 
populations change over time and can adapt to their environments. But is 
biological life the only thing that can evolve? The term evolution is used 
commonly to refer to *change* in many contexts. And there have been many
*evolutionary theories* developed with the goal of describing a process 
similar to organic evolution, but applied to other *things*. Some of these 
theories even involve a process mediated by differential success or failure
-- i.e., natural selection. Examples include theories on the evolution of 
galaxies or the universe proposed by astonomers, or of languages, 
societies, and cultures proposed by anthropologists and historians. 

**Transformation versus variational**: 
Such theories are often motivated by Darwin's theory of natural selection, 
while others predate it, but all deviate in ways that make them distinctly
different from organic evolution. The most common form of difference is that
these theories are "transformational" in nature, as opposed to being 
"variational". This is the same criticism that applies to Lamarck's theory 
of evolution. The development of a "variational" theory of evolution was
truly unique when Darwin proposed it. 

**Directionality**. Transformational theories of evolution typically involve
a prediction of directionality. For example, stars (the units) progress from
their birth to eventual death through a predictable set of stages. This 
theory for the evolution of galaxies (the collection) is predictive in the
sense that it can predict features of the galaxy based the expected state 
and differential birth or death of these stars. However, this differs from 
organic evolution in a distinct way, in that the variation that each unit 
exhibits is always the same, along one or a few trajectories, making the 
predicted state of the collection simply a description of the unfolding 
of an eventual path of the individual units.

By contrast, in a variational theory of evolution the process that generates
variation -- mutation -- is distinct from the process by which differential 
survival occurs. Indivduals (the units) acquire variation randomly as opposed
to directionally, and the process by which selection (differential birth or
death) acts on individuals is external (and can thus change unpredictably), 
as opposed to being pre-determined as part of a directional aging process. 

**Heritability and mortality of units** A second property that distinguishes 
evolutionary theories is the mortality of individual units in a group.
The lifespan of stars is of a similar magnitude to that of a galaxy composing
them, whereas the lifespan of organic individuals in a population is very short
relative to the duration of the population. Astronomical theories of evolution
are not only transformational but apply to (nearly) immortal objects, such
that there is no role for (or model of) heritability. By contrast, organic 
evolution is variational and applies to mortal objects, where the differential
survival of individual units from one generation to the next carries with 
it a change in the frequency of heritable variants of those units.

Perhaps the most similar theory of variational evolution to that of organisms
is a theory of the evolution of languages.
To this, the greatest criticism is that compared to organic evolution it is 
much less clear how to model the process by which variation arises (mutations), 
is heritable, and can be selected upon compared to the processes of 
mutation, particulate (genic/DNA) inheritance, and differential replication
that have clear definitions and statistical properties in organic evolution.

**Does culture evolve?** 
The application or development of an "evolutionary theory" of how societies
evolve has been much criticized, and was a major topic of academic and 
political debate first in the 1920s (when criticized by Franz Boaz) and later
again in the 1970s (when criticized by Lewontin and Levin). These theories 
often postulate a linear path of cultural evolution, from "barbarism" to
"technological civilization", exhibiting a clear directional/transformational
hypothesis. 

More recent theories, greatly advanced in the "Sociobiology" thesis proposed 
by E.O Wilson, are variational in nature, and led to an explosion of related
fields like "evolutionary psychology" in the following decades. Examples include
statements such as "behavior X is an adaptation because it likely provided 
an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors". Such ideas have been applied to
explain cultural features ranging from religion, to warfare, to patriarchical
power systems -- often without any associated evidence. These ideas are 
critized for arguing that if something has a (proposed) evolutionary explanation 
that it is therefore "natural" and "that's just the way it is", rather than
viewing it from a social justice perspective as something we could strive
to overcome. (See [criticism of evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_evolutionary_psychology)).


### The Modern Synthesis
The [Modern Synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)), 
or Evolutionary Synthesis, marks an important period in the 1930s-1940s 
when modern evolutionary theory came into being. This marked a widespread 
acceptance not only of Darwin's theory of descent with modification, but also
of his theory of natural selection. This sythesis involved a number of 
major symposia and publications led by a group of prominent, mostly western English-speaking scientists, but of course, involved many more people than
the few names which are often credited as the leaders of this movement.

The most significant development that spurned this major transition in the 
study of evolution was (1) advances in the fields of **probability and 
statistics**, and (2) the re-discovery and recognition of Gregor Mendel's 
work on **the rules of inheritance and independent assortment** (this will 
be covered later in class). By reconciling Darwin's theory with a theory
of genetic inheritance most critiques of natural selection that had persisted
since his publication could be well refuted. The core tenet of the
Modern Synthesis can be summarized as "adaptive evolution is caused by 
natural selection acting on particular (Mendelian) genetic variation."

A mathematical theory of population genetics was developed at this time that
allowed modeling the expected changes in allele frequencies over generations.
Remember, this is decades before the discovery of the structure of DNA 
molecules, and of a biochemical understanding of heredity, but nevertheless,
it was understood that discrete heritable units were passed from parents to
offspring, as opposed to theory of "blending" inheritance. The mathematical
models of this period are sometimes referred to as "beanbag" genetics, because
the genetic models require only assumptions about discrete variable units
between generations, like models of a population of differently colored 
bean bags. This work was famously led by Ronald Fisher, JBS Haldane, and 
Sewall Wright. We will cover population genetics and the genetical theory
of natural selection in a later session.

The Modern Synthesis is also characterized by advances in the study of 
speciation, taxonomy, and paleontology, and ideas linking population genetic
models of "microevolution" with large-scale patterns or processes in the 
diversity of life, termed "macroevolution".

## Evidence for Evolution

### The Tree of Life

**Common Ancestry**: Darwin extrapolated from the relationships among 
organisms like finches with similar morphologies, to relationships among 
major orders, to relationships among phyla, all the way to the idea of a 
universal common ancestor.

**Universal Common Ancestry**: All life is related by common ancestry, 
i.e., descended from a last universal common ancestor (LUCA).
 <!-- (e.g., Fig-2.7) -->

**Phylogeny**: A tree-like structure representing the evolutionary
relationships of organisms related by common ancestry. A phylogeny should
be read from the tips towards the root. Those sharing more recent common
ancestors are more closely related. The order/rotation/distance between names 
along the tips of a phylogeny is not informative. It is the joining
(coalescing) of ancestors backwards in time into a common ancestor on a
phylogeny that provides information about relatedness.

**Taxonomy**: Linnaen taxonomy is a hierarchical classification system used 
originally to group organisms by morphological similarities. It was developed
before the theory of evolution. It was not originally a 
quantitative method like modern phylogenetic inference, but rather a 
subjective classification system. It was not intended to represent phylogenetic 
relatedness (since this idea did not yet exist), however, 
it happened to do so pretty well. Modern taxonomies still
use the Linnaen naming system, but use phylogenetic evidence to update how 
organisms are grouped. This is one reason that many names change over time
(e.g., named groups are found to not be monophyletic: descended from a 
common ancestor to the exclusion of others not in the group.)


### Homology as Evidence for Evolution

**homology in morphology and fossils**, the inheritance of ancestral 
features into modified descendant features. This can be clearly seen
in the fossil record <!--(e.g., Fig-2.9)--> as gradual changes over time, and
often as gradual divergence among descendants from a common ancestor's
phenotype.

**homology in genetics** also at lower levels. The genome is a molecular 
encoding of information, and we find that closely related organisms have more
similar genomes. Millions of homologous units/traits. The 
universality of of the genetic code for translating codons from mRNA.

**homology of all genetic information** In fact, we can model the origin of 
all parts of the genome as arising from duplication of some previous
ancestral gene segments. We can build phylogenies not only of organisms, 
but also for gene families and even individual copies of genes.
<!-- (e.g., Fig-2.13-2.15) -->

**molecular clock** provides a means for estimating relative and/or 
absolute time from the number of genetic changes between organisms, if 
calibrated to external data. This tends to work best for divergences on
the scales of tens of millions of years, not hundreds (due to the law 
of large numbers, the mean is better approximated when there are many
more observations / less sampling error). Fossil calibrations are
placed with mixed confidence.

**testing homology** is simple in theory, but very complex in practice. 
This is because of the evolution of homoplasy: parallel or convergent 
phenotypes. Shared genetic basis or not. Sometimes intermediate. For example, 
eyes of molluscs and vertebrates. Or wings of insects and birds.
Different developmental basis. But, genes involved in light capture trace all 
the way back to archeael ancestors. This topic will be revisited in 
the topic of *evolutionary development*.

**Macroevolutionary models** Given a phylogeny, we can map characters to 
the tips of a tree and fit different statistical models for the evolution
of that character. This is a very common practice
in modern evolutionary biology. Because we can only observe the present 
(in the absence of fossils) we must ask *which model of evolution
is most likely to have produced the type of variation that we observe
today?* We usually start by fitting simple models (e.g., Brownian motion)
and compare this to more complex models. We will revisit these types of 
models in a later session on *phylogenetic methods*.
