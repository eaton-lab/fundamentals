# Theory of Evolution

--- 
## Assigned reading (before class)

- **Evolution 5th edition, Chapters 1-2.**
The first two chapters of the class textbook provide an introduction
to the history of the development of evolutionary theory, and the basic
principles of this theory (variation, selection, inheritance). Each 
of these principles will be covered in much greater detail in later
sessions.

- Buck versus Bell review.
- Fisher Genetical Theory

## Lecture Notes

### The Tree of Life

**Common Ancestry**: Darwin extrapolated from the relationships among 
organisms like finches with similar morphologies, to relationships among 
major orders, to relationships among phyla, all the way to the idea of a 
universal common ancestor.

**Universal Common Ancestry**: All life is related by common ancestry, 
i.e., descended from a last universal common ancestor (LUCA). (e.g., Fig-2.7)

**Phylogeny**: A tree-like structure representing the evolutionary
relationships of organisms related by common ancestry. A phylogeny should
be read from the tips towards the root. Those sharing more recent common
ancestors are more closely related. The order/rotation/distance between names along the tips of a phylogeny is not informative. It is the joining
(coalescing) of ancestors backwards in time into a common ancestor on a
phylogeny that provides information about relatedness.

**Taxonomy**: Linnaen taxonomy is a hierarchical classification system used 
originally to group organisms by morphological similarities. It was developed before the theory of evolution. It was not originally a 
quantitative method like modern phylogenetic inference, but rather a 
subjective classification system. It was not intended to represent phylogenetic relatedness (since this idea did not yet exist), however, 
it happened to do so pretty well. Modern taxonomies still
use the Linnaen naming system, but use phylogenetic evidence to update how 
organisms are grouped. This is one reason that many names change over time
(e.g., named groups are found to not be monophyletic: descended from a 
common ancestor to the exclusion of others not in the group.)

### Homology as Evidence for Evolution

**homology in morphology and fossils**, the inheritance of ancestral 
features into modified descendant features. This can be clearly seen
in the fossil record (e.g., Fig-2.9) as gradual changes over time, and
often as gradual divergence among descendants from a common ancestor's
phenotype.

**homology in genetics** also at lower levels. The genome is a molecular 
encoding of information, and we find that closely related organisms have more similar genomes. Millions of homologous units/traits. The 
universality of of the genetic code for translating codons from mRNA.

**homology of all genetic information** In fact, we can model the origin of 
all parts of the genome as arising from duplication of some previous
ancestral gene segments. We can build phylogenies not only of organisms, 
but also for gene families and even individual copies of genes 
(e.g., Fig-2.13-2.15)

**molecular clock** provides a means for estimating relative and/or 
absolute time from the number of genetic changes between organisms, if calibrated to external data. This tends to work best for divergences on
the scales of tens of millions of years, not hundreds (due to the law 
of large numbers, the mean is better approximated when there are many
more observations / less sampling error). Fossil calibrations are
placed with mixed confidence.

**testing homology** is simple in theory, but very complex in practice. 
This is because of the evolution of homoplasy: parallel or convergent 
phenotypes. Shared genetic basis or not. Sometimes intermediate. For example, eyes of molluscs and vertebrates. Or wings of insects and birds.
Different developmental basis. But, genes involved in light capture trace all the way back to archeael ancestors. This topic will be revisited in 
the topic of *evolutionary development*.

**Macroevolutionary models** Given a phylogeny, we can map characters to 
the tips of a tree and fit different statistical models for the evolution
of that character (e.g., Fig. 2.17, 2.21). This is a very common practice
in modern evolutionary biology. Because we can only observe the present 
(in the absence of fossils) we must ask *which model of evolution
is most likely to have produced the type of variation that we observe
today?* We usually start by fitting simple models (e.g., Brownian motion)
and compare this to more complex models. We will revisit these types of 
models in a later session on *phylogenetic methods*.

### Evolutionary theories
What can evolve? The term evolution is used to generally to refer to 
changes in many contexts. And it is even used to refer to a process
of change mediated by differential success or failures -- a process
mediated by natural selection -- in many fields. Examples include the
evolution of galaxies and the universe, or of languages and cultures.
