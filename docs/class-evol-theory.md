## Lecture Notes

### Tree of Life

**Universal Common Ancestry**: All life is related by common ancestry, 
i.e., descended from a last universal common ancestor (LUCA). (e.g., Fig-2.7)

**Phylogeny**: A tree-like structure representing the evolutionary
relationships of organisms related by common ancestry. A phylogeny should
be read from the tips towards the root. Those sharing more recent common
ancestors are more closely related. The order/rotation/distance between names
along the tips of a phylogeny is not informative.

**Taxonomy**: Linnaen taxonomy is a hierarchical classification system used 
originally to group organisms by morphological similarities. It was developed
before the theory of evolution, and was not intended to represent phylogenetic
relatedness, however, it happened to do so pretty well. Modern taxonomies still
use the Linnaen naming system, but use phylogenetic evidence to update how 
organisms are grouped. This is one reason that many names change over time
(e.g., named groups are found to not be monophyletic: descended from a 
common ancestor to the exclusion of others not in the group.)

### Homology as evidence for evolution

**Common Ancestry**: Darwin extrapolated from the relationships among 
organisms like finches with similar morphologies, to relationships among 
major orders, to relationships among phyla, all the way to the idea of a 
universal common ancestor.

**homology in morphology and fossils**, the inheritance of ancestral 
features into modified descendant features. This can be clearly seen
in the fossil record. (e.g., Fig-2.9). Consistency in the fossil record: 
layers dating to the same epoch everywhere in the world show the same 
linear patterns of diversity through time.

**homology in genetics** also at lower levels. The genome is a molecular 
encoding of information, and we find that closely related organisms have more 
similar genomes. Millions of homologous units/traits. The universality of
of the genetic code for translating codons from mRNA.

**homology of all genetic information** In fact, we can model the origin of 
all parts of the genome as arising from duplication of some previous
ancestral gene segments. We can build phylogenies not only of organisms, 
but also for individual genes copies. (e.g., Fig-2.13-2.15)

**molecular clock** provides a means for estimating relative and/or 
absolute time, if calibrated to external data. This tends to work best
for tens of millions of years, not hundreds. Fossil calibrations can 
usually be placed with mixed confidence...

**testing homology** is simple in theory, but very complex in practice. 
This is because of the evolution of homoplasy: parallel or convergent 
phenotypes. Shared genetic basis or not. Sometimes intermediate. For example,
eyes of molluscs and vertebrates. Or wings of insects and birds. Different 
developmental basis. But, genes involved in light capture trace all the way 
back to archeael ancestors. 

**Evolutionary models** Given a phylogeny, we can map characters to the tips
and model the evolution of characters using statistical models of
their evolution (Fig. 2.17, 2.21).
