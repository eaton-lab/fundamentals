## About
**Learning objectives**: By the end of this course you will (1) have an improved understanding of major concepts in evolutionary theory; (2) be familiar with modern applications of evolutionary biology; and (3) be able to read, write, and converse on the topic of evolution.

**Format:** This course will introduce both basic and advanced concepts in evolutionary theory through readings, lectures, and discussions. It is intended to be accessible to students without a background in the study of evolution, while also presenting challenging topics to more experienced students. Topics are organized into four major modules. Each contains several lectures and textbook chapters for background, as well as discussions of articles from the primary literature. Assessments include assignments and exams to test comprehension in each module, as well as a final exam.

**Reading:** This is a reading intensive class. Each session may require you to read a textbook chapter in addition to articles from the primary literature (up to 100 pages per week). Learning to read and comprehend information from technical writing is a difficult but important skill that you can improve through practice. Please come to class with notes on the readings so that you are ready for discussion. 

## Textbook
**Required Textbook:** Futuyma, D. and Kirkpatrick, M. (2023) Evolution (**Fifth edition**). Oxford.

## Assessment/Grades
- 10% participation
- 10% presentation
- 20% quizzes/assignments
- 40% 3 module exams
- 20% 1 final exam

Letter grades are assigned relative to the performance of your peers. The maximum grade will earn an A, and grades that are less than one-half of that maximum grade will be assigned an F. Between these values (max and ½ max) intervals equating to letter grades are divided equally. It is thus possible for everyone to earn an A. For example, if the top grade is 90% then the following grade categories would be assigned. Grades on a boundary are rounded up.

A: 90-85.5 (e.g., if top score was 90)  
A-: 85.5-81  
B+: 81-76.5  
B: 76.5-72  
B-: 72-67.5  
C+: 67.5-63  
C: 63-58.5  
C-: 58.5-54  
D+: 54-49.5  
D: 49.5 - 45   
F: 45 - 0 (e.g., ½ of top score is F)  
 
## Discussion participation
Participation can be earned in multiple ways: Asking questions in class; being active in group discussions; and/or attending office hours. Weekly quizzes are used to assess that readings are completed. Unexcused absences will affect your participation grade. 

## Presentation
Each student will give one 10 minute presentation near the end of class summarizing an evolutionary journal article and discussing how it relates to a topic from your own research interests.

## Assignments 
Several technical assignments will be distributed throughout the course which involve completing simple coding exercises. These do not require any prior coding experience.

## Exams
A short-answer exam is given in class at the end of each of the four modules, covering the most recent topics from the textbook, assignments, and readings. No notes, books, computers, etc are allowed during the exam. A review session is held before each exam. The final (fourth) exam is cumulative.

## Attendance policy
This course relies upon student participation and, thus, attendance is expected. Classes will not be zoomed/broadcast. Absences will incur a grade penalty unless excused. Students who are unable to attend class for health or other personal reasons should reach out to the instructors. I understand there are many legitimate reasons for absences, so do please reach out. Excused absences can be made up with special assignments.


## Accommodations for students with disabilities
If you are a student with a disability and have a Disability Services-certified ‘Accommodation Letter’ please contact the instructor before the course starts to confirm your accommodation needs. If you believe that you might have a disability that requires accommodation, you should contact Disability Services at 212-854-2388 and [disability@columbia.edu](mailto:disability@columbia.edu).

## Academic integrity
Academic dishonesty is a serious offense and will not be tolerated in the 
class. Students are expected to reference sources appropriately in any work. 
Students are allowed to discuss homework assignments but should respond to 
questions and tasks on their own, not using a group answer. Violation of the 
rules of academic integrity (e.g., plagiarizing materials) from Columbia 
College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, will result in automatic 
failure of the course. Rules and consequences are outlined in Columbia 
College’s Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity: [http://www.college.columbia.edu/faculty/resourcesforinstructors/academicintegrity/](http://www.college.columbia.edu/faculty/resourcesforinstructors/academicintegrity/)
Statement.
