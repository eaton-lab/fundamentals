## About
**Learning objectives**: By the end of this course you will (1) have an improved understanding of major concepts in evolutionary theory; (2) have improved technical reading skills; (3) have improved technical writing skills.

**Format:** This course will introduce advanced concepts in evolutionary theory through readings, lectures, and discussions. It is intended to be accessible to students regardless of their prior experience studying evolutionary theory, while also presenting advanced topics to more experienced students. Topics are organized into four major modules. Each module contains several lectures and textbook chapters for background. This is followed by discussions of articles from the primary literature. A writing workshop takes place at the end of each module, wherein students debate thesis topics in small groups and are assigned an essay.

**Reading:** This is a reading intensive class. Each session may require you to read a textbook chapter in addition to articles from the primary literature (up to 100 pages per week). Learning to read and comprehend information from technical writing is a difficult but important skill that you can improve through practice. You should come to class with notes on your readings so that you are ready for discussion. 

## Textbook
**Assigned articles:** Uploaded to Canvas.  
**Required Textbook:** Futuyma, D. and Kirkpratrick, M. (2017) Evolution (Fourth edition). Sinauer.  
[Available electronically for $12 here](https://etextbookpdf.com/product/evolution-4th-edition-futuyma-kirkpatrick-ebook-pdf).

## Assessment/Grades
Grades are based on participation (attendance and discussions), two presentations (student-led article and personal research article) and 4 written essays.   
- 20% (class/discussion participation)  
- 10% (student-led article discussion)  
- 10% (personal research article presentation)  
- 60% (4 essays)    

Grades will not be curved. However, your grade will be assigned relative to the performance of your peers. The maximum grade will earn an A, and grades that are less than one-half of that maximum grade will be assigned an F. Between these values (max and ½ max) intervals equating to letter grades are divided equally. 

**Discussion participation:** The class is largely centered around discussion of journal articles, both in terms of the whole classroom, as well as in breakout sessions of smaller groups in zoom. Participation involves asking questions, debating, and discussing the material in these settings. Missed attendance affects your participation grade. 

**Student-led Discussion presentations:** Each student will lead one article 
discussion which involves summarizing an assigned article and preparing questions to motivate a class discussion. It is recommended to attend office hours to discuss the article with the instructor or TA before presenting.

**Personal research article presentations:** Each student will present one lightning talk (4 minutes) to share an article of their choosing that is about evolution. This is an opportunity to research and share a subject of your own interest with the class.

**Essays:** Written essays will be used as the primary form of assessment, and are intended to test your comprehension and ability to synthesize ideas across multiple topics. These are to be written as max 2 page documents, single-spaced, 11pt font (i.e., default options in google docs) with proper citations. You will have the option to choose among several topics to write on, each addressing an open-ended question in evolutionary theory. You will be expected to reference the primary literature articles we discussed in class, and can optionally cite additional readings. We will discuss expectations for these essays in the writing workshops.

**Writing workshops:** Three class sessions will be devoted to ‘writing workshops’ that involve a mixture of technical writing training, discussion and debate on essay topics, and opportunities to receive feedback on drafts and outlines in small group settings.


## Attendance policy
This course relies upon student participation and, thus, attendance is expected. Absences will incur a grade penalty unless excused. Students who are unable to attend class for health or other personal reasons should reach out to the instructors. Attendance over zoom is not a substitute for attending in person, and thus requires a valid excuse. I understand that there are many legitimate reasons for absences, so do please reach out.

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
If you are a student with a disability and have a Disability Services-certified ‘Accommodation Letter’ please contact the instructor before the course starts to confirm your accommodation needs. If you believe that you might have a disability that requires accommodation, you should contact Disability Services at 212-854-2388 and [disability@columbia.edu](mailto:disability@columbia.edu).

## Academic integrity
Academic dishonesty is a serious offense and will not
be tolerated in the class. Students are expected to reference sources appropriately in any work. Students are allowed to discuss homework assignments but should respond to questions and tasks on their own, not using a group answer. Violation of the rules of academic integrity (e.g., plagiarizing materials) from Columbia College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, will result in automatic failure of the course. Rules and consequences are outlined in Columbia College’s Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity: [http://www.college.columbia.edu/faculty/resourcesforinstructors/academicintegrity/](http://www.college.columbia.edu/faculty/resourcesforinstructors/academicintegrity/)
