# MOVING this discussion much later in the semester...


### Laland Discussion;
- Straw Poll: Did you pick a side? Which was more convincing? 
- 3 Questions
	- Discuss the four processes proposed by Laland et al. Try to come up with a succinct definition for each. 

	- Niche Construction: A beaver building a dam affects how the beaver interacts with its environment (the env can be constructed/modified). Thus, the evolution of niche constructing behavior affects the evolutionary trajectory of beavers. In theory, selection can act on this one behavior as a way to adapt to many potential threats. Does this mean the beaver has become more evolvable? How is this distinct from other adaptations, such as the evolution of camouflage or mating calls? 

	- Plasticity/Development: "often it is the trait that comes first; genes that cement it follow, sometimes several generations later." 
	Come up with a plausible theoretical example of this. How might variation arise first and then become cemented?

	- Why do you think you were convinced by one side more than the other? Writing style, arguments for the importance of each topic, historical arguments, perceived sassiness/pettiness? 

	- Has anyone changed their mind after discussion? Why/


- Yes SIDE points
	- Darwin conceived evolution without knowing all its parts/details, and now we focus almost exclusively on one of those details: genetics. An alternative view is now arising that supercedes genetics.
	We are a group that supports that view, particularly of the importance of development.
	- We are a growing group, but some people really don't like us, perhaps because of the hitsory of other bad arguments against evolutionary theory. Here we describe our 4 main points.

	- The modern synthesis is based on changes in frequencies of alleles, and this constrains the way people think. We add "development", "plasticity", "niche construction", and "extra-genetic inh.". 
	- Examples of each.
		- Cichlid fish parallel evolution, coincidence?
		- Examples are rather vague.
	- Development is a direct cause of why and how adaptation and speiation occur, and rates and patterns of evolution.
	- Not just a constraint, it is creative as to which forms evolve.
	- Accepting ESS will help to overcome limits.

- No SIDE
	- Evolution has always drawn on evidence and ideas from a wealth of fields, and evolved as a discipline as new ideas surfaced. This is evident with molecular biology, selfish DNA, kin selection, etc. The ideas proposed by the YES side are well known, and have been since Darwin. No New Synthesis is needed.
	- These ideas have been discussed for decades or more. Instead of arguing over whether they are discussed enough, those interested in them should just do the experiments and try to find support for them.
	- There are many other topics in evolution that warrant an extended
	synthesis. Why these four? It is self-serving.
	- "Gene-centric" is used as a slander, but this paradigm has proven extremely useful. While there is some evidence for each of these other phenomena, their explanatory power is so much less generalized than genetics that they remain add-ons to the core evo phenomena. 
	- While those phenomena can act a proximate/mechanistic causes of phenotypic change, they only matter for evolution when codified into heritable genetic changes that selection can act on.
	- ONce again, get to work, stop complaining.


- EES versus SET
- New proceses discovered since the modern synthesis are important *causes* of evolution, not just outcomes. 

- 1. Developmental Bias
	- Parallel evolution of Cichlid Jaw types in sister lakes
	- SET requires random genetic variation coincidence
	- Developmental bias produces certain morphologies more readily, 
	e.g., by developing less or more of a certain part, on which selection can then act to assimilate/fix.
	- Plasticity produces a certain morphology x environment, selection can act to assimilate/fix the trait regardless of environment.
	- "trait first, genes to cement it follow, perhaps generations later."

- 2. Evolvability
	- Dev. bias. can affect opportunity/speed to adapt, and thus also speciation.
	- SET treats environment as background condition, whereas ESS treats environment as a trait of an organism -- evolved and changeable.

- 3. Extra genetic inheritance.
	- EES likes these. Example, parents construct develop env of offspring, which contributes to their similarity.
	- Epigenetic markers, such as methylation, affect expression.
	- Also social behaviors.
	- Niche constructions.
