## Lecture notes
- Species originate by the process of speciation (splitting).
- Why do species speciation?
- What determines rates of speciation?
- When is speciation complete?
- Is speciation reversible?


### Spatial patterns of divergence
- allopatry, sympatry, parapatry


### Species concepts
- What are species? Many definitions, termed 'species concepts'.
- BSC: biological species concept:
	- groups of interbreeding organisms. 
	- pros: clear criterion, though sometimes allows fuzzy leakage. 
	- cons: often cannot be tested (giant squid, fossils) and not all do sex.
- PSC: phylogenetic species concept:
	- groups of genetic clusters.
	- pros: 
		- easy to test.
	- cons:
		- the strict definition of reciprocal monophyly has been discarded, since coalescent theory shows us that for very large populations this can require unreasonable requirements.
		- species delimitation methods using MSC.
		- Knowles paper show MSC ~ species delimitation is false correlation.

These two concepts are the most popular, and can be interpreted as different
temporal views on the speciation process. Both examine the *effects* of reproductive
isolation -- a cessation of gene flow between populations. The PSC asks whether
there is evidence that such cessation has at least started: evidence for 
significant genetic structure. By contrast, the BSC asks whether this process
has become complete: reproduction is no longer possible between the two.

In either case, hybrid zones present a challenge, as they occur on the 
continuum of the process of speciation between start and potential 
irreversible end state. 



### Reproductive isolation
- Premating barriers
- Postmating barriers
- Postzygotic barriers


### Genetic basis of postygotic isolation
- Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMIs).


### Selection
- "Ecological speciation" posits that most speciation occurs as a result of 
divergent ecological adaptation. 

- "Mutation-order" speciation posits that the random fixation of alleles while
in isolation can lead to postzygotic isolation. 

- Ecological speciation is more widely supported by evidence, especially for 
speciation in sympatry/parapatry, i.e., in the face of gene flow.


### Reinforcement
Selection against hybrids can lead to fixation of reproductive barriers between
populations, thus *reinforcing* speciation between them.


### Polyploidy/hybrid
Speciation can occur instantaneously through a process of polyploid speciation.
This involves a doubling of the genome size, such that new hybrids are instantly
incompatible with their progenitor species. This is somewhat common in plants.

- Homoploid hybrid speciation
- Allopolyploid speciation


### Genic view of speciation
Introgression is the incorporation of *some of the genome* of one lineage 
into another. In the initial stage, a hybrid F1 has one chromosome from a 
parent in each population. However, in subsequent generations recombination 
will cause this individual to pass on recombinant products of its genome 
to offpsring. If it has back-crossed with an individual from one or the other 
parental populations, the offspring will inherit this smaller recombined chunks
of one population history, and a pure background from the other population. 
Over time, as this process is repeated, many small chunks of ancestry can be
exchanged between populations, and these continue to be broken down into smaller
and smaller segments.

Some speciation genomic methods examine the distribution of introgressed regions
between two populations. The size of regions is informative about the time since
gene flow occurred between the lineages. The variation in the distribution of
introgressed regions throughout the genome can be informative about selection.
Neutral regions can often be introgressed freely, whereas genome regions under
local selection may not be introgressed because selection removes them.

As genetic linkage builds up between regions under selection and other nearby
regions, more and more of the genome may become resistent to being introgressed, 
because it is linked to adaptive alleles. Thus, a gradual accumulation of 
postzygotic incompatibilities is expected to arise over time under the genic
view of speciation.

### Final Review

- Neutral Theory:
	- Most variation with and between genomes is neutral.
	- Deleterious variants are removed quickly.
	- Most variants are neutral or 'nearly neutral' (drift is stronger than s).
	- Beneficial variants are rare, and fix rapidly.

- Selectionists
	- There are many examples of adaptive evolution.
	- Many genes show evidence of selection positive selection.
	- Linkage disequilibrium causes most of the genome to be affected by the 
	small proportion of the genome that does experience selection.
	- Positive relationship between recomb and mut shows that regions with 
	low recomb have not bounced back from selection yet.

- Coalescent
	- Evolution creates genealogical patterns of relatedness among gene copies
	within and among populations.
	- The coalescent provides a mathematical approximation to estimate the 
	distribution of genealogies that would be observed given a population
	Ne, or a species tree.
	- Mutations occur 'on genealogies' (in ancestors that leave descendant
	gene copies that are sampled).
	- By studying genealogies we can understand expected genetic diversity, 
	and vice versa.
