## Lecture notes

Coming soon...

### Genealogies and sequence variation
- when mutations occur in germline cells they are passed to descendants.
- a sample of gene copies in a population will only exhibit genetic variation
if mutations occurred since their common ancestor.
- variation in DNA sequences is linked to genealogies.

### Genealogical variation
- Different unlinked regions of the genome trace back different genealogical
histories.
- Linked regions of the genome trace back similar genealogical histories. This
similarity IS THE SOURCE of linkage disequilibrium. 

### The top of a population model
- We learned that the expected waiting time until all samples in a population
coalesce is approximately 4N. 
- However, coalescent models have another relevant parameter, Tau, which
the length of the model interval.
- If the interval is less than 4N generations in length, then it is expected
that many samples will not yet have coalesced at the top of it.


### Homology, 
Evolutionary relationships are evident in patterns of **homology** -- characters that are shared among taxa and which were inherited from a common ancestor. 

The grouping of organisms based on shared derived characters was in practice since even before Darwin. 

However, it is important within an evolutionary context to consider whether a shared trait is derived in the group that shares it, versus whether it is ancestral, and the taxa that do not share it may have a derived state. 

Synapomorphy versus plesiomorphy.


### Monophyly, clade, MRCA
...


### Homoplasy
The repeated evolution of a character state. Homoplasy can occur when the rate of evolution of a character is high, or if there are few character states that it can transition between. In either case, if too many transitions occur back and forth between states, it is difficult to ...


### Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS)


### Why different genomic regions have different genealogical trees


### Introgression


### Methods for inferring phylogenies
Distance, Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian

- Inferring divergence times (dates)
