## Lecture outline	

#### Genealogies and sequence variation
- when mutations occur in germline cells they are passed to descendants.
- a sample of gene copies in a population will only exhibit genetic variation
if mutations occurred since their common ancestor.
- variation in DNA sequences is linked to genealogies.

#### Genealogical variation
- Different unlinked regions of the genome trace back different genealogical
histories.
- Linked regions of the genome trace back similar genealogical histories. This
similarity IS THE SOURCE of linkage disequilibrium. 

#### The top of a population model
- We learned that the expected waiting time until all samples in a population
coalesce is approximately 4N. 
- However, coalescent models have another relevant parameter, Tau, which
the length of the model interval.
- If the interval is less than 4N generations in length, then it is expected
that many samples will not yet have coalesced at the top of it.
