## Assigned reading (before class)

## Discussion Notes
- Chen:
	- Did cellular life require the sythesis of a cellular membrane by a replicating molecule, or could this association arise randomly from chemical/physical reactions?
	- Forward-engineering: Provide a replicating RNA molecule with an abundance of vesicles.
	- Vesicles containing replicating RNA would have higher osmotic pressure, causing them to steal membrane from others.
	- relies only the phys properties of semi-permeable membrane.
	- The author uses ‘fitness’ in several contexts. Is it used consistently?
	- The author uses 'emergence of the cell'. Why not evolution? Is there a distinction?
