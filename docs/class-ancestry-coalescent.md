## Lecture notes


### Gene copies
Every gene copy is a descendant of an ancestral gene copy that was 
replicated. In the case of diploid sexual organisms the ancestral copy may 
have been replicated thousands, or even millions of times, through meiosis 
(e.g., production of sperm or eggs), however only a few of these are likely
to successfully mate to form new diploid zygotes.

In the case of Wright-Fisher model with finite population size, 




### Ancestry databases
Genotyping of DNA a crime scenes of the Golden State Killer did not turn up
any hits in the CODIS database -- the largest DNA database used by US 
Law Enforcement, based on 13-20 microsatellite markers (short repeat loci).
This database is made up of samples collected by law enforcement through
enforced or coerced methods over many years. Although quite large, the 
amount of information pales in comparison to that available in *private*
DNA databases, collected by ancestry companies such as 23andme or 
ancestryDNA.

These private databases genotype samples at thousands of SNPs, thus providing
a more dense sampling of information across the genome. In addition, users 
volunteer their information to these databases, as opposed to being coerced,
and thus presence in the database is not associated with a prior criminal 
record or investigation, like in CODIS.

Police do not have access to these private databases, however, many users 
upload their SNP data to public websites that offer additional analyses 
not available on commercial sites. (Some of these additional analyses are 
not offered on the commercial sites for legal, ethical, or privacy reasons.)
Some of these third party sites, such as GEDmatch, save and share the data 
publicly.
