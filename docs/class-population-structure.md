## Lecture notes

### Genealogies and sequence variation
- when mutations occur in germline cells they are passed on to descendants.
- a sample of gene copies in a population will only exhibit genetic variation
if mutations occurred since their common ancestor.
- variation in DNA sequences is linked to genealogies.

### Genealogical variation
- Different unlinked regions of the genome trace back different genealogical
histories.
- Linked regions of the genome trace back more similar genealogical histories
(i.e., they share more ancestors in common). This similarity is the cause of linkage disequilibrium. 

### The top of a population model
- We learned that the expected waiting time until all samples in a population
coalesce is approximately 4N. 
- However, coalescent models have another relevant parameter, Tau, which
the length of the model interval.
- If the interval is less than 4N generations in length, then it is expected
that many samples will not have yet coalesced by the time they reach the 
top of the population interval. At this point, we must also model what 
happens in the ancestral population, which may have a different Ne, or may
contain addition gene copies.
- See Notebook 5 on demographic models and species trees.
