- Species originate by the process of speciation (splitting).

### Species concepts
- What are species? Many definitions, termed 'species concepts'.
- BSC: biological species concept:
	- groups of interbreeding organisms. 
	- pros: clear criterion, though sometimes allows fuzzy leakage. 
	- cons: often cannot be tested (giant squid, fossils) and not all do sex.
- PSC: phylogenetic species concept:
	- groups of genetic clusters.
	- pros:
		- easy to test.
	- cons:
		- the strict definition of reciprocal monophyly has been discarded, since coalescent theory shows us that for very large populations this can require unreasonable requirements.
		- species delimitation methods using MSC.
		- Knowles paper show MSC ~ species delimitation is false correlation.

These two concepts are the most popular, and can be interpreted as different
temporal views on the speciation process. Both examine the *effects* of reproductive
isolation -- a cessation of gene flow between populations. The PSC asks whether
there is evidence that such cessation has at least started: evidence for 
significant genetic structure. By contrast, the BSC asks whether this process
has become complete: reproduction is no longer possible between the two.

In either case, hybrid zones present a challenge, as they occur on the 
continuum of the process of speciation between start and potential 
irreversible end state. 


### Introgression: 
Incorporation of *some of the genome* of one lineage into 
another. In the initial stage, two interbreeding individuals create an F1
individual that has one chromosome from a parent in each population. However,
in subsequent generations recombination can occur such that this F1 passes
on a chromosome that is partly from one population and partly from the other.
If it has back-crossed with an individual from one or the other parental 
populations, then it now contains only this smaller recombined chunk of the
genome. This is at first a large introgressed chunk, but over time may become
smaller and smaller as recombination breaks it up. It may be lost or fixed
by random genetic drift, or, change if frequency due to positive or negative
selection.

### Final Review

- Neutral Theory:
	- Most variation with and between genomes is neutral.
	- Deleterious variants are removed quickly.
	- Most variants are neutral or 'nearly neutral' (drift is stronger than s).
	- Beneficial variants are rare, and fix rapidly.

- Selectionists
	- There are many examples of adaptive evolution.
	- Many genes show evidence of selection positive selection.
	- Linkage disequilibrium causes most of the genome to be affected by the 
	small proportion of the genome that does experience selection.
	- Positive relationship between recomb and mut shows that regions with 
	low recomb have not bounced back from selection yet.

- Coalescent
	- Evolution creates genealogical patterns of relatedness among gene copies
	within and among populations.
	- The coalescent provides a mathematical approximation to estimate the 
	distribution of genealogies that would be observed given a population
	Ne, or a species tree.
	- Mutations occur 'on genealogies' (in ancestors that leave descendant
	gene copies that are sampled).
	- By studying genealogies we can understand expected genetic diversity, 
	and vice versa. 


- Phylogeny


- Speciation


- Introgression
Introgression introduces genome segments from one lineage (population or 
species) into another. 


- Selection
Even though the coalescent model is a model of neutral evolution, the concept
of using genealogies to understand evolutionary patterns holds true even 
when selection occurs. 

For example, a selective sweep appears as a region of the genome with greatly
reduced genetic diversity across a set of samples in a population, relative 
to the average genetic diversity across the genome. 

This can be interpreted 


- Essay I Feedback:
	- Citation formatting.
	- How to cite reviews/textbook: seek the source.
	- Make thesis statements more concise.
	- Ensure each topic sentence is an argument supporting the thesis. Overall, every did well at making these clear and identifiable.
	- Ensure each paragraph sticks to its topic sentence topic without wandering.
	- Do not introduce new ideas in the conclusion. It is not a discussion section. Essays are direct, concise, and structured.
