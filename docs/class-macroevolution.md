- Futuyma textbook chapter 20 
<!-- (do not assign next time, use Jablonski article instead) 
This chapter is really not theoretical at all, and way off topic often.
Focused on evidence for evolution.

## Lecture notes

### Macroevolution Topics

#### Macroevolution definition
- "Evolution above the species level". 
- How has organismal diversity arisen? What determines the rate?
- Why are some lineages more diverse than others?
- What role does chance/contingency play in evolution (is evolution predictable?)
- Does most evolutionary change occur gradually, or saltationally (by jumps)?
- Are there major trends/patterns in the history of life?

#### The origin of major new forms of life
The textbook chapter describes several examples of patterns of evolution
among clades. This is interesting not only to demonstrate some of the best
examples in the fossil record where we have observed both gradual and in 
some cases large changes in the fossil record, but even moreso when contrasted
against the view of only what can be observed today among extant life. The 
transition between hippo and whales seems so large that it is difficult
to imagine, but fossils show a gradual transition from an ancestor that
was quite different from either form today.
