# Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

Review genetical theory of natural selection. Discuss fitness landscapes, 
optima, measuring selection, and defining fitness. Introduce quant gen 
from chapter 6, but we will not assign it as reading.


## Assigned and due for this class (9/20/23)

- **Evolution 5th edition, Chapter 3** (Natural Selection and Adaptation; 21 pages)
This chapter delves into the process of *natural selection* how to define 
adaptations, and how adaptation has shaped the diversity of life.
- **Evolution 5th edition, Chapter 5** (Genetical Theory of Natural Selection;
32 pages) A mathematical framework for measuring selection and fitness.

Introduction to the genetical theory of natural selection.
Natural selection is manifest by the differential survival and reproduction
of some units over others based on variation in their heritable phenotypes. 
This differential *success* can be measured, and is termed *fitness*. 
In most cases, evolutionary biologists are interested in *relative fitness*
but in some cases we may also examine *absolute fitness*. Each can be 
measured in numerous different ways, and at many different scales. This 
impacts the way that we develop statistical models for predicting evolutionary
responses to selection, and also impacts the language that we use to 
properly describe evolution. 

This unit is focused on how to measure and describe selection and fitness.

## Lecture Notes


### Phenotypic variation
How is phenotypic variation usually distributed in populations? This was a
question that was famously studied by R.A. Fisher
