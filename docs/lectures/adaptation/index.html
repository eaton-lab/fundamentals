              Natural selection can occur without causing evolution (e.g., no heritability of selected trait),
              and similarly, evolution can occur without natural selection (e.g., genetic drift changes allele
              frequencies by chance). 
              <br><br>
              Natural selection happens anytime that a non-random set of entities differ in fitness. For evolution
              to happen, the non-random variation affecting their fitness must be heritable.

              <p style="font-size: 0.9em; text-align: left; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%">
	            We used the term 'entities' for natural selection earlier, why? 
	            <br><br>
	            Because not only individuals experience selection. Genotypes (combinations of genes) 
	            or individual genes (in sexual organisms) can exhibit differences in fitness owing
	            to heritable variation (alleles) that affects their replication to the next generation.
	            <br><br>
	            Selection can thus act on gene copies in a population, combination of gene copies in 
	            a population (genotypes), individuals in a population (classic concept of selection), 
	            subsets of individuals in a populations (e.g. particular sex determination); 
	            or even on different populations (group selection; thought to be less common).
            	<br><br>
            	Most interestingly, selection can act in antagonistic ways at different levels, creating
            	genetic conflicts. For example, between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, between genes
            	and individuals, or between sexes.

	            	Selfish genetic elements are segments of DNA or RNA that spread in a population by natural 
	            	selection regardless of their effect on individuals. This is most recognizable when they 
	            	cause genetic conflicts, such that they are detrimental to the individual. Examples are 
	            	transposable elements (TEs). These often have either no effect on fitness, or only slightly 
	            	deleterious effects, and thus can accumulate in genomes. They spread not only by replication 
	            	of the genome itself (i.e., organismal reproduction) but also by copying and pasting within an individual.
	            	<br><br>
	            	Any gene at which a particular allele is more successful than an alternative can be
	            	viewed as a "selfish gene". By viewing genes through this lens we can better understand 
	            	the evolution of many puzzling traits that are difficult to explain by selection at the
	            	organismal level alone.

              	For example, altruistic behavior is unlikely to evolve through selection on individuals, 
              	since individuals are expected to maximize their own fitness. However, if multiple individuals
              	are likely to share the same gene copies, for example, because they are siblings, then an 
              	allele at a gene that makes siblings more likely to cooperate may be more fit than an 
              	alternative allele, if it leads the siblings as a group to leave more offspring (more copies of
              	that gene copy) to the next generation. This is termed kin selection.
              	<br><br>
								The expected outcomes of kin selection, or group selection, on the spread of an allele in 
								a population can be mathematically modeled. Would a new allele with effect X increase in 
								frequency? Would a cheater allele that subverts X increase in frequency? Under what conditions 
								might X versus Y evolve? We will learn about such models in the next lesson.

							Selection on one trait can have side effects on the distribution of another. For example, in Figure 3.13 a children's toy contains a sieve for marbles of different sizes. The different sized marbles also happen to be different colors. The sieve separates marbles based on size (selection based on size) but incidentally this also leads to separate by color, becaues the two are linked. We will learn later about how traits can be "genetically linked", or unlinked.
							<br><br>
							This is important to understand. Not all features of an organism are adaptations -- i.e., a result of natural selection. Many may have evolved by random genetic drift, or, they may have been pulled along because they were linked to other genes that were under selection. It is easy to come up with plausible stories for why a trait may have been adaptive. In many cases, these stories should be tested before they are believed.

								Consider a widespread species distributed over a range of habitat types. If
								a novel trait increases in frequency within one type of habitat, where it 
								increases local fitness, then we would describe it as an adaptation.
								<br><br>
								However, if the trait then spreads to other populations across the species, and
								eventually fixes everywhere, regardless of of the habitat type the population
								occurs in, is it still an adaptation? It does not increase fitness in these 
								alternative environments.
								<br><br>
								Which lines of evidence would or would not support this trait as evidence of 
								an adaptation?
