	              Darwin proposed that organisms descend from shared common ancestors, and that all organisms descended from a long-past universal common ancestor (LUCA). There is now overwhelming evidence to support this. The key evidence of common ancestry is <b>homology</b>, the inheritance of ancestral features that become modified in descendants.
	              <br><br>
	              Homology is abundantly evident in the fossil record as gradual changes over time among descendant lineages from a common ancestor's phenotype. Similarly, homology is evident in the features of extant organisms in the similarity of structures among organisms despite differences in function

	              The genome is a molecular encoding of huge amounts of information and each site or gene represents a homologous character inherited from a common ancestor. Close relatives have had less time for mutations (modifications) to occur since diverging from a common ancestor, while more distant relatives have had more time to accumulate differences. These differences underlie their many morphological and functional differences.

		             Both within the fossil record, and using inferred phylogenetic relationship among extant organisms, we can study patterns of trait evolution. 
		             <br><br>
		             Given the process of common ancestry, we expect organisms to diverge over time from each other and from their common ancestral phenotype. But diverge in what ways? Random evolution among descendant lineages is unlikely to have given rise to the diversity of organisms we see today, particularly in terms of their apparent fit to their environments. Instead, evidence of Darwin's other main thesis, natural selection, is abundantly evident in nature through patterns of trait evolution.

Here the same homologous traits evolved similar character states repeatedly, and in ways that were correlated with their environment.

								The concept of homology is clearly defined, however, identifying homology among biological structures can in some cases be quite challenging. For example, although the genetic and developmental basis by which eyes evolved in cephalopods versus vertebrates are very different, it has also been found that they share <b>some homologous genetic basis</b>. 
								<br><br>
								For example, genes involved in light capture trace all the way back to single-celled archeael ancestors. Thus, deep homology at this very ancient level may still have influenced their likelihood of evolving these convergent features. This idea will be revisited in the topic of evolutionary development later in class.

	              <br><br>
	              (3) Finally, comparative studies of living taxa provide ample evidence of evolution by fitting with expectations of models of evolution. See Box

              	increased throughout the Phanerozoic (Cambrian to now). 
		          	<br><br>
		          	There have been 4-5 mass extinction events that vary significantly

		          	The background extinction rate has decreased through time. An increase
		          	in speciation rate is not necessary to explain this increase in 
		          	diversity. Does this represent an "optimization of fitness through time"?

              	Has the background extinction rate really decreased through time? And if
              	so, how? Are newer species less prone to extinction than in the past?
              	<br><br>
              	Val Valen measured the length of time that genera persisted throughout
              	the Phanerozoic and showed that this duration has remained constant. 
              	Lineages have not evolved to become more resistant to extinction!
              	<br><br>
              	One explanation for this is termed the Red Queen Hypothesis. It states
              	that because the selective environment (and thus risk of extinction) 
              	is always changing, it is not possible to become optimally adapted.
              	Instead, a lineage must continually evolve simply to survive (keep 
              	running just to stay in place).
