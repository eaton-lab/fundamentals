	            The precise pattern of taxonomic richness in geologic time remains the
							subject of considerable debate, but the broad outline of that history is now
							generally accepted. There were comparatively few species during the Paleozoic
							and	early Mesozoic, and diversity increased substantially in the past hundred 
							million years (Signor 1990).
	            <br><br>
							The biosphere
							reached the zenith of the longest sustained period of taxonomic diversification
							in the Earth's history in the Pliocene and Pleistocene (5-2Mya), when climatic
							change and the advent of organized human activity then checked that diversification.

								diversity of marine organisms is the arrangement of continental land masses
								on the earth's surface. 
								<br><br>
								When the continents are gathered into a single land mass there are
								few distinct provinces. Land masses restrict the ability of	marine organisms
								to disperse or migrate, depending upon their position, especially when the 
								continents interrupt east/west currents. 
								<br><br>
								Sim­ilarly, dispersed land masses allow the independent evolution of terrestrial
								faunas and floras, such as the unique biotas of Australia or Madagasgar (or
								South America prior to the formation of the Central American land bridge)

            		Extinction risk is highly non-random. Past adaptations that make
            		some species more or less resistant to human disturbance did not
            		arise as adaptations to survive humans, rather they arose through
            		evolution by drift or selection given their everyday toil for 
            		survival and reproduction. So it was the same for other mass 
            		extinctions. Non-randomly, some clades of organisms had adaptations
            		that by chance made them more likely to survive an unpredictable 
            		event.
