Notes FUTURE: 
	- do chapter 4 in module 1 to introduce VARIATION/inheritance. NB1-2
	- then, do chapter 5 (selection) and read on fitness and adaptation. This
	includes callback to chapter 3, but I'm OK skipping chapter 6 (quantgen).
	- Start Module 2 with chapter 7 and genealogy, with callbacks to HW, 
	WF models, and mutations on way to teaching genealogy.
