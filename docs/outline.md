Notes FUTURE: 
	- do chapter 4 in module 1 to introduce VARIATION/inheritance. NB1-2
	- then, do chapter 5 (selection) and read on fitness and adaptation. This
	includes callback to chapter 3, but I'm OK skipping chapter 6 (quantgen).
	- Start Module 2 with chapter 7 and genealogy, with callbacks to HW, 
	WF models, and mutations on way to teaching genealogy.

## Session 14 (M) Macro I
- Introduce topics
	- Macroevolutionary questions
	- How does diversity and complexity arise?
		- origin of new forms: mammal cranial evolution
		- origin of complexity: eyes
	- What forms can or will arise more often?
		- development, deep homology, constraints
	- Niche conservatism
		- definition
		- freezing tolerance and hard barriers
		- debate
		- "easier to move than to evolve" plants
		- stasis in temp among marine molluscs over 3My despite climate change. [Saupe]
	- Eldredge and Gould sought to explain the saltational patterns in the fossil record.
		- evolution is gradual but fossil record is incomplete?
		- or, rapid changes occur in evolution? Fig. 20.16
		- rates in the fossil record are very slow compared to contemporary measurements, why?
		- Fig. 20.12
	- Diversification rates
		- Living fossils versus species rich clades, why?
		- Key innovations
		- ...
		- Evolutionary dead-ends? e.g., selfing?
		-
