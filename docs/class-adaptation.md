# Adaptation

The Panglossian paradigm.

## Assigned reading (before class)
- Gould Panglossian paradigm. *This classic paper questions the common practice
of assigning an adaptationist hypotheses to every biological observation. In 
many cases, non-adaptive processes may explain organismal features.*

## Lecture notes

### Defining adaptations
An *adaptation* is a trait that evolved by natural selection. Although 
this seems like a very simple concept, it can be a challenging subject 
to describe and explain accurately. 

### Temporal nature of adaptations
An adaptation does not arise in response to some environmental pressure. 
Rather, selection acts on phenotypic variation within populations, leading
to differential fitness. If the phenotypic variation has a heritable genetic
basis, then the population will evolve in response to selection, with the
mean phenotypic shifting towards a distribution with higher fitness.

In this case, we can describe the beneficial phenotype as an adaptation. 
If we examine populations in and outside of this extreme environment and
find that those in the environment consistently exhibit the novel phenotype
then this is additional evidence that the trait is adaptive, and is not 
correlated with presence in this environment by chance.

What if this trait eventually sweeps through the entire species, regardless
of whether or not it is in the novel environment? Is it still considered an
adaptation *to* the novel environment? 



An adaptation does not need to be fixed in a population
