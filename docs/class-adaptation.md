## Lecture notes

### Defining adaptations
An *adaptation* is a trait that evolved by natural selection. Although 
this seems like a very simple concept, it can be a challenging subject 
to describe and explain accurately.

**Adaptation:** *a characteristic that enhances (or enhanced) the survival 
or reproduction of organisms that bear it, relative to alternative character
states.*

Adaptive evolution may be slow as Darwin proposed, but nevertheless we now 
have many examples where it has been clearly observed and measured within 
our lifetimes.
	- Soapberry bug example.
	- resistance to insecticide, herbicide, antibiotics.
	- response to overexploitation if fishing or hunting.

**Natural selection:** *any consistent difference in fitness among 'different 
classes' (e.g., genotypes, organisms) of biological entities based on their 
phenotypes.*

**Fitness:** *The number of offspring an individual leaves in the next 
generation (survival and fitness).* Or, measured as multiple components 
of fitness for multiple life stages (i.e., are your children also fit?). 
We will further refine this definition next class.

**Important Note**: Natural selection can occur without causing evolution 
(e.g., no heritability of selected trait), and similarly, evolution 
can occur without natural selection (e.g., genetic drift changes allele
frequencies by chance). Natural selection happens anytime that a 
non-random set of entities differ in fitness. For evolution to happen, 
the non-random variation affecting their fitness must be heritable.

### Speaking of adaptations
How to talk about adaptations/selection. We often use shorthand but this
can sound teleological or anthropomorphic in ways that can be misleading
to the general public. It is important to be aware of this and thus when
and where it is appropriate to further define your meaning.
	- selection 'favors' this...
	- selection is a force...
In the end, natural selection is a "statistical differences in 
reproductive success among genes, organisms, or populations, 
based on variation among them".

### Levels of selection
We used the term 'entities' for natural selection earlier, why? 
Because not only individuals experience selection. Genotypes or, 
b/c of recombination, individual genes (in sexual organisms), can 
also have differences in success/fitness (replication to next 
generation). Thus selection can act on gene copies in a population, 
combination of gene copies in a population (genotypes), individuals
in a population (classic concept of selection), or even on different
populations (group selection; thought to be less common).

Selfish genetic elements are segments of DNA or RNA that spread in a
population by natural selection regardless of their effect on individuals.
This is most recognizable when they cause genetic conflicts, such that they
are detrimental to the individual. Examples are **transposable elements**
(TEs). These often have either no effect on fitness, or only slightly
deleterious effects, and thus can accumulate in genomes. They spread not only
by replication of the genome itself (i.e., organismal reproduction) but also
by copying and pasting within an individual.

Any gene at which a particular allele is more successful than an alternative
can be viewed as a "selfish gene". By viewing genes through this lens we can
better understand the evolution of many puzzling traits that are difficult
to explain by selection at the organismal level alone. 

For example, altruistic behavior is unlikely to evolve through selection on
individuals, since individuals are expected to maximize their own fitness.
However, if multiple individuals are likely to share the same gene copies, 
for example, because they are siblings, then an allele at a gene that makes 
siblings more likely to cooperate may be more fit than an alternative allele,
if it leads the siblings as a group to leave more offspring (more copies of
that gene copy) to the next generation. This is termed **kin selection**.

The expected outcomes of kin selection, or group selection, on the spread of
an allele in a population can be mathematically modeled. Would a new allele
with effect X increase in frequency? Would a cheater allele that subverts X
increase in frequency? Under what conditions might X versus Y evolve? We will
learn about such models in the next lesson.


### "Selection of" and "Selection for"
Selection on one trait can have side effects on the distribution of another.
For example, in Figure 3.13 a children's toy contains a sieve for marbles of
different sizes. The different sized marbles also happen to be different 
colors. The sieve separates marbles based on size (selection based on size)
but incidentally this also leads to separate by color, becaues the two are
linked. We will learn later about how traits can be "genetically linked", 
or unlinked.

This is important to understand. Not all features of an organism are 
adaptations -- i.e., a result of natural selection. Many may have evolved
by random genetic drift, or, they may have been pulled along because they
were linked to other genes that were under selection. It is easy to come up
with plausible stories for why a trait may have been adaptive. In many 
cases, these stories should be tested before they are believed.

### Evidence of adaptations
Why are adaptation hard to identify? It can be hard to imagine all of the
possible alternative states that a character may exhibit, whereas it is 
easy to come up with a plausible adaptive story for its evolution. There
are four main alternative explanations for the evolution of organismal 
features that do not require them to be adaptations:

1. A trait may be necessary due to physics, chemistry, or constraints. 
Example: Hemoglobin is red b/c of chemistry, not due to selection for blood
to be red in color.
2. Trait may have evolved by random genetic drift.
3. Trait may be correlated with another character that evolved by selection,
drift, developmental constraint, etc.
4. Trait may be inherited and long-removed from a possible adaptive function
they served in a long distant ancestor. Why do humans have live birth instead 
of laying eggs? The reason is not because live birth evolved *in humans*, 
relative to an egg-laying ancestor, rather, long ago selection may have acted
on a character that affected egg-laying vs. live-birth in a population that
was variable for this trait. But this trait is fixed in all humans 
because it was long ago fixed in the ancestor of all eutherian mammals.

### Evidence for adaptations (based on morphology)
Inconclusive, but suggestive evidence for adaptations:

**Complexity**: why does a complex trait exist and not something simpler? 
Example: peacock's feathers. More complex features likely involve costs 
to fitness. Non-functional complexities will usually degrade by 
genetic drift if not maintained by selection.

**Design**: corresponds with optimized models: aerodynamics, heat dissipation, 
camouflage. Similarity with a theoretical optimum model
is highly unlikely to evolve by random genetic drift. 

**Experiments**: show that a trait is better than a modified 
version of it. You could paint a peacock's feathers white and measure
its relative fitness. This shows evidence that the trait is 
more fit in this population than *this alternative*, but does not test
many other alternatives, and does not test whether the alternative 
trait could have evolved in this population's history, and if, whether
it would then be more fit.

**Comparative method**: Phylogenetic patterns can reveal repeated evolution 
that is unlikely by random chance. (e.g., Anoles, Sticklebacks, 
[Viburnum](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01823-x)).

**Imperfections and constraints**: Selection acts on existing variation,
not from scratch, and thus often finds imperfect pathways to solutions.
For example, selection can increase the frequency of genetic variants
in a particular population at a particular time. It cannot fix the best 
of all conceivable variants because that combination may be very 
unlikely to arise by chance. 

### Variation in adaptations
But why do some organisms adapt to certain environmental stress while
others do not? For example, some species of grass have rapidly evolved
tolerance to heavy metal contamination in soils, while others in the vicinity
did not. Perhaps due to lack of variation. This does not just mean random
mutations to any site in the genome -- that can happen readily over the
course of many generations -- but rather functional diversity. Diversity of
functions that can arise by few mutations from the existing genome. If 
entirely new gene functions or interactions are required to evolve tolerance,
then it is understandable that it may take much longer to arise.

Another reason why we may see adaptation in only one species and not another
is that we have a biased view of which adaptations we are looking for. Perhaps
the species that did not adapt to the contaminated soil has in fact adapted
to the non-contaminated soil, but that is not what we were looking for. If 
the two organisms we were examining already specialized on slight differences
in soil, then perhaps each adapted to different variations on this environment.
It is our own bias that we view only adaptation to the contaminated soil to
be an expected outcome. Evolution is not goal oriented.

Another possible reason is competition between the two species. For example,
perhaps one species adapted to the contaminated soil because of character
displacement -- i.e., it was beneficial to this species not just because it
provided a new habitat, but specifically because it reduced competition with
the competitor which occurs in the other soil type.


### Temporal nature of adaptations
An adaptation does not arise in response to some environmental pressure. 
Rather, selection acts on phenotypic variation within populations, leading
to differential fitness. If the phenotypic variation has a heritable genetic
basis, then the population will evolve in response to selection, with the
mean phenotypic shifting towards a distribution with higher fitness.

In this case, we can describe the beneficial phenotype as an adaptation. 
If we examine populations in and outside of this extreme environment and
find that those in the environment consistently exhibit the novel phenotype
then this is additional evidence that the trait is adaptive, and is not 
correlated with presence in this environment by chance.

What if this trait eventually sweeps through the entire species, regardless
of whether or not it is in the novel environment? Is it still considered an
adaptation *to* the novel environment? 

Birds evolved wings that enabled flight. When this trait first arose in 
a bird ancestor it was likely associated with increased fitness. Are wings
still an adaptation today? Clipping the wings of a bird is likely to 
decrease its fitness. So yes? But this does not mean flight evolved in every
bird independently as an adaptation. Indeed, there are multiple examples 
of birds evolving modifications to flight (different from clipping a wing)
that likely represent adaptations to their specific environment. Examples are
flightless birds such as ostriches, or modifications to wings for more efficient
swimming, as in penguins.


### Adaptive/Fitness landscape
In evolutionary biology, fitness landscapes or adaptive landscapes (types of evolutionary landscapes) are used to visualize the relationship between genotypes and reproductive success. It is assumed that every genotype has a well-defined replication rate (often referred to as fitness). This fitness is the "height" of the landscape. Genotypes which are similar are said to be "close" to each other, while those that are very different are "far" from each other. The set of all possible genotypes, their degree of similarity, and their related fitness values is then called a fitness landscape. The idea of a fitness landscape is a metaphor to help explain flawed forms in evolution by natural selection, including exploits and glitches in animals like their reactions to supernormal stimuli.
The idea of studying evolution by visualizing the distribution of fitness values as a kind of landscape was first introduced by Sewall Wright in 1932. (Wikipedia)

A bivariate or multivariate plot showing fitness x phenotype(s), or 
fitness x genotypes(s). It is often easier to envision and measure
for phenotypes, which may vary continuously in a population, than 
for genotypes, which vary discretely. One should thus think of 
genotypes as composing allelic combinations at many loci, such that
you could imagine continuous-like variation.

An adaptive landscape can show both local and global optima, 
represented as *peaks* on the landscape, surrounded by *valleys*
with lower fitness. Movement between fitness peaks on a landscape
is a major topic of interest in evolution. Do populations get
stuck on suboptimal peaks? How easy is it to move between peaks
of similar fitness? How does the depth of valleys influence the
probabilities of shifts?

<!-- 
### Shifting Balance Theory
Wright developed the ["shifting balance theory"](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/sewall-wright-and-the-development-of-shifting-30508/).
This proposed that the effects of pairs of alleles should not always be 
modeled as simply being *additive* (sum of their individual effects), but 
should also include the potential for *non-additive* effects, such
as epistasis. Epistatic effects such as dominance were well known 
from Mendel's earlier work, but later work revealed many additional
forms of epistasis, including incomplete dominance (intermediate
phenotypes due to interactions, not just additive effects; 
e.g., pink). Wright examined what would happen under theoretical models
where these different modes of heterozygote phenotypes have different
fitness consequences (e.g., lower than either homozygote, intermediate, 
or greater).

Wright developed the concept of adative landscapes to describe the 
predicted evolution of populations given a relationship between 
genotypes and fitness. Selection will push populations upward toward
genotypes of higher fitness, whereas genetic drift or random mutations
will cause populations to disperse around regions of similar fitness

At its core, the shifting balance theory is a process that permits populations
to hold onto selective gains (i.e., local fitness peaks in the adaptive 
landscape) while still being able to randomly explore neighboring genotype 
space for possibly superior peaks. Wright's solution to these conflicting 
aims was population subdivision. He thought that many, if not most, species
were subdivided into small populations that exchanged only a few migrants 
with each other but were not completely isolated (Wright, 1931, 1932, 1977, 
1978). Because of the small size of each of these populations, genetic drift 
would have a significant effect on the genetic composition of each, thus 
allowing the populations to differentiate genetically by an appreciable amount. 
In this way, each of the populations would act as a small experiment in 
evolution (Wade & Goodnight, 1998).

- Phase 1, the exploratory phase, is characterized by the action of genetic 
drift. As a result, the small populations move around in genotypic space.
Most stay on the suboptimal fitness peak, but some get caught in adaptive valleys.
- In phase 2, natural selection causes the populations that are in the adaptive
valleys to move through genotypic space toward new, higher-fitness peaks.
- Finally, in phase 3, those populations that are at higher fitness peaks send 
off migrants to the other populations, and these migrants cause the other 
populations to move to the higher fitness peaks. Eventually, all of the 
populations (the metapopulation) move to the higher fitness peak as a result 
of this process.

Remains controversial. 

Fisher argued that ecological factors would change the adaptive landscape 
faster than populations could shift between peaks via the shifting balance 
theory. In other words, according to Fisher, hills would become valleys and 
valleys would become hills faster than populations could move from one hill
to the next (Fisher, 1958).
