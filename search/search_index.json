If it has back-crossed with an individual from one or the other  parental populations, the offspring will inherit this smaller recombined chunks of one population history, and a pure background from the other population.

Because not only individuals experience selection. Genotypes or,  b/c of recombination, individual genes (in sexual organisms), can  also have differences in success/fitness (replication to next  generation). Thus selection can act on gene copies in a population,  combination of gene copies in a population (genotypes), individuals in a population (classic concept of selection), or even on different populations (group selection; thought to be less common).</p> <p>Selfish genetic elements are segments of DNA or RNA that spread in a population by natural selection regardless of their effect on individuals. This is most recognizable when they cause genetic conflicts, such that they are detrimental to the individual. Examples are transposable elements (TEs). These often have either no effect on fitness, or only slightly deleterious effects, and thus can accumulate in genomes. They spread not only by replication of the genome itself (i.e., organismal reproduction) but also by copying and pasting within an individual.</p> <p>Any gene at which a particular allele is more successful than an alternative can be viewed as a \"selfish gene\". By viewing genes through this lens we can better understand the evolution of many puzzling traits that are difficult to explain by selection at the organismal level alone. </p> <p>For example, altruistic behavior is unlikely to evolve through selection on individuals, since individuals are expected to maximize their own fitness. However, if multiple individuals are likely to share the same gene copies,  for example, because they are siblings, then an allele at a gene that makes  siblings more likely to cooperate may be more fit than an alternative allele, if it leads the siblings as a group to leave more offspring (more copies of that gene copy) to the next generation. This is termed kin selection.</p> <p>The expected outcomes of kin selection, or group selection, on the spread of an allele in a population can be mathematically modeled. Would a new allele with effect X increase in frequency? Would a cheater allele that subverts X increase in frequency? Under what conditions might X versus Y evolve?

Not all features of an organism are  adaptations -- i.e., a result of natural selection.

Why do humans have live birth instead  of laying eggs? The reason is not because live birth evolved in humans,  relative to an egg-laying ancestor, rather, long ago selection may have acted on a character that affected egg-laying vs. live-birth in a population that was variable for this trait.

For example, some species of grass have rapidly evolved tolerance to heavy metal contamination in soils, while others in the vicinity did not. Perhaps due to lack of variation. This does not just mean random mutations to any site in the genome -- that can happen readily over the course of many generations -- but rather functional diversity. Diversity of functions that can arise by few mutations from the existing genome. If  entirely new gene functions or interactions are required to evolve tolerance, then it is understandable that it may take much longer to arise.</p> <p>Another reason why we may see adaptation in only one species and not another is that we have a biased view of which adaptations we are looking for. Perhaps the species that did not adapt to the contaminated soil has in fact adapted to the non-contaminated soil, but that is not what we were looking for. If  the two organisms we were examining already specialized on slight differences in soil, then perhaps each adapted to different variations on this environment. It is our own bias that we view only adaptation to the contaminated soil to be an expected outcome. Evolution is not goal oriented.</p> <p>Another possible reason is competition between the two species.

When this trait first arose in  a bird ancestor it was likely associated with increased fitness. Are wings still an adaptation today? Clipping the wings of a bird is likely to  decrease its fitness.

This voyage lasted from 1831-1836 and began when Darwin was just 22 years old. It took  years of interactions with other naturalists, including corresponding with  experts on plants, birds, and other organisms that Darwin collected, for him to fully form his ideas from observations such as the diversity among  \"Darwin's finches\" in the Galapagos islands, which motivated his ideas about descent with modification.</p> <p>Lamarck: Among others, Jean-Baptiste Chavelier de Lamarck famously  proposed a theory of evolution involving descent from common ancestors 50  years before Darwin. Lamarck's theory was wrong, however, in proposing how  changes among organisms evolve through time. He proposed a process by which  acquired characteristics of individuals are inherited from one generation  to the next, leading to population change. This is often demonstrated by a  giraffe stretching its neck over its lifetime  to reach foliage, leading to  longer necks passed on to their offspring. This theory of \"inheritance of  acquired characteristics\" is known to false, but nevertheless put forward a  testable hypothesis.</p> <p>Lyell: In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century writings by astronomers and geologists, including particularly those of James Hutton and Charles Lyell, transformed  our understanding of earth history by proposing the theory of  uniformitarianism -- that the same geological processes that we observe  today, such as erosion by wind and water, are likely to be the same processes  that gave rise to major geological formations. Thus, the Earth is very old, and even processes with very small effects can lead to great changes over over long periods of time.</p> <p>Malthus: The concept of Malthusianism is derived from writings of the economist Thomas Malthus, most notably his  \"Essay on the Principle of Population\" in 1798. This essay argued that  population growth would outstretch the supply of resources/food, even in the face of technological advances, leading to eventual population collapse. This theory has had a significant impact on ideas of population control, and as an argument for capitalism. Darwin encountered Malthus' writing in 1838 and  had a very different takeaway from it. He was already convinced of the common descent of life at this point, but had not yet developed the theory of natural selection. The idea of that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive greatly impacted Darwin, and led him to ponder the consequences of  differential survival -- that those with particular characteristics may be more likely to survive and reproduce than others, thus passing on those  characters to be more frequent in the subsequent generation.</p>"},{"location":"class-evol-theory/#the-modern-synthesis","title":"The Modern Synthesis","text":"<p>The Modern Synthesis,  or Evolutionary Synthesis, marks an important period in the 1930s-1940s  when modern evolutionary theory came into being. This marked a widespread  acceptance not only of Darwin's theory of descent with modification, but also of his theory of natural selection. This sythesis involved a number of  major symposia and publications led by a group of prominent, mostly western  English-speaking scientists, but of course, involved many more people than the few names which are typically credited as the leaders of this movement.</p> <p>The most significant development that spurned this major transition in the  study of evolution was (1) advances in the fields of probability and  statistics, and (2) the re-discovery and recognition of Gregor Mendel's  work on the rules of inheritance and independent assortment (this will  be covered later in class). By reconciling Darwin's theory with a theory of genetic inheritance most critiques of natural selection that had persisted since his publication could be well refuted. The core tenet of the Modern Synthesis can be summarized as \"adaptive evolution is caused by  natural selection acting on particulate (Mendelian) genetic variation.\"</p> <p>A mathematical theory of population genetics was developed at this time that allowed modeling the expected changes in allele frequencies over generations. Remember, this is decades before the discovery of the structure of DNA  molecules, and of a biochemical understanding of heredity, but nevertheless, it was understood that discrete heritable units were passed from parents to offspring, in contrast to a theory of \"blending\" inheritance. The mathematical models of this period are sometimes referred to as \"beanbag\" genetics, because the genetic models require only assumptions about the change in frequencies  of discrete variable units between generations (like models of a population  of differently colored bean bags). This work was famously led by Ronald Fisher, JBS Haldane, and Sewall Wright.

But is  biological life the only thing that can evolve? The term evolution is used  commonly to refer to change in many contexts. And there have been many evolutionary theories developed with the goal of describing a process  similar to organic evolution, but applied to other things. Some of these  theories even involve a process mediated by differential success or failure -- i.e., natural selection. Examples include theories on the evolution of  galaxies or the universe proposed by astonomers, or of languages,  societies, and cultures proposed by anthropologists and historians. </p> <p>Transformation versus variational:  Such theories are often motivated by Darwin's theory of natural selection,  while others predate it, but all deviate in ways that make them distinctly different from organic evolution. The most common form of difference is that these theories are \"transformational\" in nature, as opposed to being  \"variational\". This is the same criticism that applies to Lamarck's theory  of evolution. The development of a \"variational\" theory of evolution was truly unique when Darwin proposed it. </p> <p>Directionality. Transformational theories of evolution typically involve a prediction of directionality. For example, stars (the units) progress from their birth to eventual death through a predictable set of stages. This  theory for the evolution of galaxies (the collection) is predictive in the sense that it can predict features of the galaxy based the expected state  and differential birth or death of these stars. However, this differs from  organic evolution in a distinct way: the variation that each unit exhibits is always the same, along one or few trajectories of aging, making the  predicted state of the collection simply a description of the unfolding  of a teleological path of change of the individual units.</p> <p>By contrast, in a variational theory of evolution the process that generates variation -- mutation -- is distinct from the process by which differential  survival occurs. Individuals (the units) acquire variation randomly as  opposed to directionally, and the process by which selection (differential  birth or death) acts on individuals is external (and can thus change  unpredictably), as opposed to being pre-determined as part of a directional (teleological) process. </p> <p>Perhaps the most similar theory of variational evolution to that of organic evolution is a theory of the evolution of languages. To this, the greatest criticism is that compared to organic evolution it is much less clear how to model the process by which variation arises (mutations), is heritable (how is language replicated between generations), and is subject to selection, compared to the processes of mutation, particulate (genic/DNA) inheritance, and differential replication that have clear definitions and statistical  properties in organic evolution. </p> <p>Does culture evolve?  The application or development of an \"evolutionary theory\" of how societies evolve has been much criticized, and was a major topic of academic and  political debate first in the 1920s (when criticized by Franz Boaz) and later again in the 1970s (when criticized by Lewontin and Levin). These theories  often postulate a linear path of cultural evolution, from \"barbarism\" to \"technological civilization\", exhibiting a clear directional/transformational hypothesis. These have mostly fallen out of favor.</p> <p>More recent theories, such as those advanced in the \"Sociobiology\" thesis  by E.O Wilson, are variational in nature, and propose that culture is a consequence of organic evolution, and can thus be understood by applying  standard evolutionary theory in the context of the genetic basis of  variation in behavior, heritability of this variation, and selection on it. This led to an explosion of related fields like \"evolutionary psychology\"  in the following decades. Examples include statements such as \"behavior X is  an adaptation because it likely provided an evolutionary advantage to our  ancestors\". Such ideas have been applied to explain cultural features ranging from religion, to warfare, to patriarchical power systems -- often without  much or any associated evidence.  These ideas are often critized for arguing that if something has a (proposed)  evolutionary explanation that it is therefore \"natural\" and \"just the way it is\", rather than viewing it from a social justice perspective as something we  could and should strive to overcome.

Darwin wrote on how modern/Victorian society was largely removed from the type of natural selection that acts on other societies that  still interact more intensely with nature. </p> <p>The idea of organized action to select on human population, or  eugenics, was largely developed and first championed by Francis Galton,  a half-cousin of Darwin. Darwin strongly disagreed with Galton's theory. The first usage of the term eugenics was in 1883, one year after Darwin's death.</p> <p>Eugenics became an academic discipline, especially in Britain and the US.  Interestingly, many of the ideas of eugenics rely more strongly on the idea of genetic determinism -- simply that human traits are genetically  determined -- than they do to Darwin's theory of evolution (i.e., these ideas do not relate to adaptation or common ancestry of species, but simply to  the idea of genetic inheritance. In fact they would apply equally to a  LaMarkian view of evolution).  Many early geneticists were not Darwinians, and evolutionary  theory was not needed for eugenic policies based on genetic determinism. </p> <p>In fact, eugenic practices have been well documented in human history dating back long before the development of evolutionary theory. Given that human  populations developed selective breeding methods for plants and animals, it is not that surprising that societies could have applied such practices to  humans. This includes documentation of infanticide against children born with physical abnormalities. Of stories about selective breeding for warrior or athletic ability in Greek and Samnite culters. These later examples are  consideredc likely to be stories as opposed to widespread societal  practices.</p> <p>The British and American Eugenics societies were formed in 1907 and 1921,  respectively. The academic nature of these writings was used as justification for many social and governmental practices of xenophobia. Eugenics justified \"scientific racism\". </p> <p>Eugenic policies in the US were implemented in the early 1900s that promoted the sterilization of people deemed to have mental disorders, to justify  racist practices including segregation and laws against interracial marriage (anti-miscegenation laws),  and to justify restrictive and racist immigration policies. Many of the most famous politicians of this era supported eugenics, including Winston Churchill, Teddy Roosevelt. There were many outspoken critics of the eugenics movement as well, such as the Columbia University anthropologist Franz Boas, and to some extent, the Catholic church.</p> <p>The scientific reputation of eugenics declined after the second world war largely in response to the racial policies enacted by Nazi Germany. By the  end of the war Germany had committed mass murder of people that were  considered to be \"unfit\" or \"degenerate\". In addition the approximately  6 million Jews murdered in the holocaust, this included mass killings of  disabled people, homosexuals, and other minority groups. </p> <p>Race laws and practices in the US were explicitly used as models by  Nazi Germany in developing the  Nuremberg Laws which stripped Jews of their citizenship rights. In some  ways, the racial laws in Germany were less severe than those in the US at  this time.

In fact, it has even been argued that \"It is impossible to really understand  evolution without an ability to accurately interpret phylogenetic trees\".  This is true, and important, as there are several common pitfalls that  even practiced researchers often make when reading phylogenetic trees that can lead them to mis-intepret their meaning.</p> <p>Phylogenetic trees represent branching events in the evolutionary history of  a set of samples. The samples (e.g., populations, species) are represented  at the tips and their ancestors at interior nodes in a tree. Any set of samples shares a most recent common ancestor (mrca) at some point in time. A group of samples that share a MRCA to the exclusion of all other samples in  a tree are defined as a clade, or monophyletic clade. A tree is composed  of many clades that are nested within each other.

A number of common mistakes  made when reading phylogenetic trees are listed below.</p> <ul> <li>Misinterpreting the tip order as meaningful about evolutionary relationships as opposed to tracing back from tips to find shared ancestors (trees should be read in the direction from to tips to root, not along the axis of the tips). </li> <li>Not recognizing the meaning or possible lack of meaning in branch lengths. Often branch lengths may be artifically lengthened simply to show relationships more clearly.</li> <li>Not recognizing whether a tree is rooted or not. Sometimes we do not know the rooting of a tree, in which case directionality of evolution is not known. However, rates and patterns of change along branches of a tree can still be  measured on unrooted trees.</li> <li>Referring to one extant clade or organism as an ancestor of another is  incorrect. For example, to say that Humans evolved from apes is wrong.  Rather, Humans are a member of the extant clade of apes. In terms of a  specific ape lineage, like a Chimpanzee, humans diverged from a common ancestor  with chimps at some time in the past (i.e., not from chimps directly), and both lienages have evolved for equal amounts of time since.</li> <li>Referring to an extant clade as \"basal\" or \"ancient\" based on its level  of diversity or appearance. Your textbook makes this mistake, referring to  Ginkgo as both a basal and ancient lineage. While it is true that the lineage that includes extant ginkgos diverged from the clade that includes extant  angiosperms long ago, both lineages have diverged from their common ancestor for the same amount of time. The fact that one has diversified into a greater number of extant species currently than the other has nothing to do with whether one of the other is \"ancient\". It is accurate, however, to describe that the MRCA of extant and extinct ginkgos (as known from the fossil record) is older than the most recent common ancestor of all angiosperms.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"class-tree-thinking/#phylogenetic-inference","title":"Phylogenetic Inference","text":"<p>The field of phylogenetics concerns the inference of phylogenetic relationships (trees) from data. In most cases we cannot directly observe extinct ancestors and  so we instead apply statistical approaches to infer a phylogenetic tree that is most consistent with the data we can observe: differences among extant samples. Phylogenetic methods examine homologous characters to fit models of transitions in character states. For example, each site of a DNA sequence is a character with possible states A, C, T or G. Although DNA is overwhelmingly the most common type of data analyzed in modern phylogenetics, trees can also be inferred from morphological characters. We will revisit phylogenetic  methods in a later lecture.</p> <p>One goal of phylogenetics is to infer the tree-of-life -- a phylogeny for all extant species.

We will also learn more later about methods for studying the distribution  of branch lengths on phylogenies to infer rates of speciation and extinction to test hypotheses about the history of diversification of lineages.

Thus, the evolution of niche constructing behavior affects the evolutionary trajectory of beavers. In theory, selection can act on this one behavior as a way to adapt to many potential threats.

Why these four? It is self-serving.</li> <li>\"Gene-centric\" is used as a slander, but this paradigm has proven extremely useful.

It is intended to be accessible to students without a background in the study of evolution, while also presenting challenging topics to more experienced students. Topics are organized into four major modules. Each contains several lectures and textbook chapters for background, as well as discussions of articles from the primary literature. Assessments include assignments and exams to test comprehension in each module, as well as a final exam.</p> <p>Reading: This is a reading intensive class. Each session may require you to read a textbook chapter in addition to articles from the primary literature (up to 100 pages per week). Learning to read and comprehend information from technical writing is a difficult but important skill that you can improve through practice. Please come to class with notes on the readings so that you are ready for discussion. </p>"},{"location":"syllabus/#textbook","title":"Textbook","text":"<p>Required Textbook: Futuyma, D. and Kirkpatrick, M.
