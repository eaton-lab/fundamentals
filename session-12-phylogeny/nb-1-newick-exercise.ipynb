You can follow along by executing each code cell in order, from the top of this notebook, to the bottom, by holding the shift key and pressing enter (or by pressing the Run button in the toolbar.) \n",

Alternatively, though, the edge lengths of a tree can represent the amount of change observed between samples. For example, below the edge lengths could represent the amount of DNA sequence divergence between samples caused by mutations. If one sample has a higher rate of molecular substitution than another then the edge lengths will not necessarily align at zero. This information is informative about rates, but not so much about time. Converting rate estimates to divergence time estimates is an important topic of research in evolution. "

The problem is, for many types of phylogenetic inference we only care about the number of changes on the tree, which we can calculate without knowing the root. Trees can be represented in unrooted form, but it is not always obvious. Best practice is to state whether a tree is rooted or not. Often a polytomy (unresolved split) at the base of the tree indicates whether it is rooted. \n",
